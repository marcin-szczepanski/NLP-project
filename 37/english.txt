damage to the projector.

-	Do not place the projector on
a carpet, rug or other similar
surface. It may prevent a adequate
ventilation of the projector bottom.
This product should be mounted to
a wall or ceiling only.

-	Never push the projector or spill
any kind of liquid into the projector.

-	Leave an adequate distance (30
cm or more) around the projector.

Place this projector in adequate
yy
temperature and humidity
conditions.
- Install this projector only in
a location where adequate
temperature and humidity is
available. (See p.66)
Don’t place the projector where it
yy
can be covered with excessive dust.
-T
 his may cause overheating of the
projector.
Do not obstruct the slots and
yy
openings of the projector. This may
cause overheating and cause a fire
hazard.
This projector is manufactured using
yy
high-precision technology. You may,
however, see tiny black points and/
or bright points (red, blue or green)
that continuously appear on the
projector Screen. This is a normal
result of the manufacturing process
and does not indicate a malfunction.

Basic Operation of the Projector

1	 Place the projector on a sturdy and horizontal surface.
2	Place the projector with the desired distance from the screen. The distance

between the projector and the screen determines the actual size of the image.

3	Position the projector so that the lens is set at a right angle to the screen. If the

projector is not set at a right angle, the screen image will be crooked. Although,
slight angles can be counteracted using the Keystone adjustement. (See p.19).

4	After placing the projector in its desired location, connect the video input(s).
Then connect the power cable to the projector and the wall outlet.

connected USB storage device is
operating. When such a device is
suddenly separated or unplugged,
the stored files or the USB storage
device may be damaged.
Please do not connect the USB
yy
storage device which was artificially
maneuvered on the PC. The
device may cause the product to
malfunction or fail to be played.
Never forget to use only a USB
storage device which has normal
music files, image files, movie files
or text files.
Please use only a USB storage
yy
device which was formatted as
a FAT16, FAT32 and NTFS file
system provided with the Windows
operating system. In case of a
storage device formatted as a
different utility programmed which
is not supported by Windows, it
may not be recognized.
Please connect power to a USB
