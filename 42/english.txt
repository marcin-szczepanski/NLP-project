ENGLISH

CAUTION
RISK OF ELECTRIC SHOCK
DO NOT OPEN

CAUTION : TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ELECTRIC SHOCK, DO NOT
REMOVE COVER (OR BACK). NO USER-SERVICEABLE PARTS INSIDE.
REFER TO QUALIFIED SERVICE PERSONNEL.
This symbol is intended to alert the user to the presence of
uninsulated “dangerous voltage” within the product’s
enclosure that may be of sufficient magnitude to constitute a risk
of electric shock to persons.
This symbol is intended to alert the user to the presence of
important operating and maintenance (servicing)
instructions in the literature accompanying the appliance.
WARNING : TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FIRE AND ELECTRIC SHOCK,
DO NOT EXPOSE THIS PRODUCT TO RAIN OR MOISTURE.
TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF FIRE, KEEP CANDLES OR
OTHER ITMES WITH OPEN FLAMES AWAY FROM THIS
PRODUCT AT ALL TIMES.
•• Do not place the TV and/or remote control in the following
environments:
-- A location exposed to direct sunlight
-- An area with high humidity such as a bathroom
-- Near any heat source such as stoves and other devices that produce
heat
-- Near kitchen counters or humidifiers where they can easily be
exposed to steam or oil
-- An area exposed to rain or wind
-- Near containers of water such as vases
Otherwise, this may result in fire, electric shock, malfunction or
product deformation.
•• Do not place the product where it might be exposed to dust. This may
cause a fire hazard.
•• Mains Plug is the TV connecting/disconnecting device to AC mains
electric supply. This plug must remain readily attached and operable
when TV is in use.

2

•• Do not touch the power plug with wet hands. Additionally, if the cord
pin is wet or covered with dust, dry the power plug completely or
wipe dust off. You may be electrocuted due to excess moisture.
•• Make sure to connect Mains cable to compliant AC mains socket with
Grounded earth pin. (Except for devices which are not grounded on
earth.) Otherwise possibility you may be electrocuted or injured.
•• Insert power cable plug completely into wall socket otherwise if not
secured completely into socket, fire ignition may break out.
•• Ensure the power cord does not come into contact with hot objects
such as a heater. This may cause a fire or an electric shock hazard.
•• Do not place a heavy object, or the product itself, on power cables.
Otherwise, this may result in fire or electric shock.
•• Bend antenna cable between inside and outside building to prevent
rain from flowing in. This may cause water damaged inside the
Product and could give an electric shock.
•• When mounting TV onto wall make sure to neatly install and isolate
cabling from rear of TV as to not create possibility of electric shock /
fire hazard.
•• Do not plug too many electrical devices into a single multiple
electrical outlet. Otherwise, this may result in fire due to overheating.
•• Do not drop the product or let it fall over when connecting external
devices. Otherwise, this may result in injury or damage to the
product.
•• Keep the anti-moisture packing material or vinyl packing out of the
reach of children. Anti-moisture material is harmful if swallowed. If
swallowed by mistake, force the patient to vomit and visit the nearest
hospital. Additionally, vinyl packing can cause suffocation. Keep it out
of the reach of children.
•• Do not let your children climb or cling onto the TV.
Otherwise, the TV may fall over, which may cause serious injury.
•• Dispose of used batteries carefully to ensure that a small child
does not consume them. Please seek Doctor- Medical Attention
immediately if child consumes batteries.
•• Do not insert any metal objects/conductors (like a metal chopstick/
cutlery/screwdriver) into the end of power cable while the power
plug is plugged into wall socket. Additionally, do not touch the
power plug right after unplugging from the wall socket. You may be
electrocuted.

•• Only use an authorized AC adapter and power cord approved by
LG Electronics. Otherwise, this may result in fire, electric shock,
malfunction or product deformation.
•• Never Disassemble the AC adapter or power cord. This may result in
fire or electric shock.
•• Be careful in handling the adapter to prevent any external shocks to
it. An external shock may cause damage to the adapter.
•• Make sure the power cord is connected securely to the power plug
on the TV.
•• Install the product where no radio wave occurs.
•• There should be enough distance between an outside antenna and
power lines to keep the former from touching the latter even when
the antenna falls. This may cause an electric shock.
•• Do not install the product on places such as unstable shelves or
inclined surfaces. Also avoid places where there is vibration or where
the product cannot be fully supported. Otherwise, the product may
fall or flip over, which may cause injury or damage to the product.
•• If you install the TV on a stand, you need to take actions to prevent
the product from overturning. Otherwise, the product may fall over,
which may cause injury.
•• If you intend to mount the product to a wall, attach VESA standard
mounting interface (optional parts) to the back of the product. When
you install the set to use the wall mounting bracket (optional parts),
fix it carefully so as not to drop. (Only OLED65/77G7*)
•• Only use the attachments / accessories specified by the manufacturer.
•• When installing the antenna, consult with a qualified service
technician. If not installed by a qualified technician, this may create a
fire hazard or an electric shock hazard.
•• We recommend that you maintain a distance of at least 2 to 7 times
the diagonal screen size when watching TV. If you watch TV for a long
period of time, this may cause blurred vision.
•• Only use the specified type of battery. This could cause damage to the
remote control.
•• Do not mix new batteries with old batteries. This may cause the
batteries to overheat and leak.
•• Batteries should not be exposed to excessive heat. For example, keep
away from direct Sunlight, open fireplace and electric heaters.

Troubleshooting
Cannot control the TV with the remote control.

No image display and no sound is produced.
•• Check if the product is turned on.
•• Check if the power cord is connected to a wall outlet.
•• Check if there is a problem in the wall outlet by connecting other
products.
The TV turns off suddenly.
•• Check the power control settings. The power supply may be
interrupted.
•• Check if the Sleep Timer / Timer Power Off is activated in the
Timers settings.
•• Check if the Auto Power Off is activated in the General Eco
Mode settings. (Depending on model)
•• If there is no signal while the TV is on, the TV will turn off
automatically after 15 minutes of inactivity.
When connecting to the PC (HDMI), ‘No Signal’ or ‘Invalid Format’ is
displayed.
•• Turn the TV off/on using the remote control.
•• Reconnect the HDMI cable.
•• Restart the PC with the TV on.

•• If the product feels cold to the touch, there may be a small “flicker”
when it is turned on. This is normal, there is nothing wrong with
product.
•• This panel is an advanced product that contains millions of pixels.
You may see tiny black dots and/or brightly coloured dots (white, red,
blue or green) at a size of 1 ppm on the panel. This does not indicate
a malfunction and does not affect the performance and reliability of
the product.
This phenomenon also occurs in third-party products and is not
subject to exchange or refund.
•• You may find different brightness and color of the panel depending
on your viewing position(left/right/top/down).
This phenomenon occurs due to the characteristic of the panel. It is
not related with the product performance, and it is not malfunction.
•• Displaying a still image for a prolonged period of time may cause
image sticking. Avoid displaying a fixed image on the TV screen for a
long period of time.
•• Some horizontal lines may appear when the Pixel Refresher feature is
performed. It is normal and there is no need to be concerned.

ENGLISH

Generated Sound

ENGLISH

•• “Cracking” noise: A cracking noise that occurs when watching or
turning off the TV is generated by plastic thermal contraction due to
temperature and humidity. This noise is common for products where
thermal deformation is required.
•• Electrical circuit humming/panel buzzing: A low level noise is
generated from a high-speed switching circuit, which supplies a large
amount of current to operate a product. It varies depending on the
product.
This generated sound does not affect the performance and reliability
of the product.

[ ][Data02][ ][Data03][ ][Data04][ ][Data05][Cr]
Digital channels have a Physical, Major, and Minor
channel number. The Physical number is the actual
digital channel number, the Major is the number that
the channel should be mapped to, and the Minor is
the sub-channel. Since the ATSC tuner automatically
maps the channel from the Major / Minor number,
the Physical number is not required when sending a
command in Digital.
