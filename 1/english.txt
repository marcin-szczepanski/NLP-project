2. TRAINING COMPUTER PARTS

1.

Polar RS800CX training computer: displays and records your heart rate and other exercise data during
exercise.

2.

Polar Polar H3 heart rate sensor: sends the heart rate signal to the training computer. Includes a
connector and strap.

CD-ROM: The CD includes Polar ProTrainer 5

TM

software and a complete user manual.

Polarpersonaltrainer.con web service: Polarpersonaltrainer.com is your online training diary and interactive
training community that keeps you motivated.

The latest version of this user manual can be downloaded at www.polar.com/support.

Optional Accessories

1.

Polar s3/s3+ stride sensorTM W.I.N.D.: transmits the running speed/pace and distance measurements to
the training computer. Also measures running cadence and stride length.

2.

Polar G3/G5 GPS sensorTM W.I.N.D.: provides speed, distance and location data, as well as track
information, in all outdoor sports using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. You can transfer
your track data to the Polar ProTrainer 5 software to view in Google Earth or to convert into a GPX file.
For more information, see software help.

3.

Polar Cycling Speed SensorTM W.I.N.D.: measures speed and distance when cycling.

4.

Polar Cadence Sensor

TM

W.I.N.D.: measures cadence, i.e. crank revolutions per minute when cycling.

When using the Polar G3/G5 GPS sensor with a Polar s3/s3+ stride sensor or Polar cycling speed sensor, the GPS
will only be used for location and route tracking. However, when the s3/s3+ stride sensor or cycling speed sensor is
not in range (e.g. the type of sport changes during training), the training computer automatically retrieves speed
and distance data from the GPS sensor. This way the speed and distance measurement is secured throughout your
training session. To start using the s3/s3+ stride sensor or the cycling speed sensor again, long press LIGHT and
select Seek sensor.
For video tutorials on how to use these accessories, go to http://www.polar.com/en/polar_community/videos.

Prepare For Training

ENGLISH

Calibrate the Polar s3/s3+ Stride Sensor W.I.N.D.
Optional calibration of the s3/s3+ sensor* improves accuracy of speed, pace, and distance measurements.
It is recommended that you calibrate the sensor before using it for the first time, if there are significant
changes in your running style, or if the position of the sensor on the shoe is dramatically changed (e.g. if
you have new running shoes). You can calibrate the sensor by running a known distance, or by setting the
calibration factor manually.

You can calibrate one s3/s3+ sensor for each shoe setting.

Calibrate Sensor by Running a Distance (on-the-fly calibration)
You can calibrate the sensor at any phase of your exercise with lap distance correction, provided you are
not exercising with distance-based targets. Just run a known distance, preferably more than 1000 meters.
Make sure the sensor function in the training computer is on (Settings > Features > Shoes/bikes > Shoes
1/2/3 > On).
In time mode press OK once. Select Settings > Shoes/bikes > Shoes 1/2/3.
Then select Start and start running.
When you are in a starting point of a known lap distance, press OK. When you have run the whole lap
distance, press OK. Then calibrate the sensor by choosing either alternative:
1.

Press and hold LIGHT to go to Settings. Or,

2.

Press STOP once. Select Settings.

Select Calibrate > Correct lap > Set true lap distance . Fix the displayed lap distance with the distance
you just ran, and press OK.
Calibration complete and the factor are displayed. The sensor is now calibrated and ready for action.

Set Calibration Factor Manually
The calibration factor is calculated as a ratio of the actual distance to the uncalibrated distance. Example:
you run 1200m, the training computer shows a distance of 1180m, the calibration factor is 1.000.
Calculate the new calibration factor as follows: 1.000*1200/1180 = 1.017. The measuring range for the
factor is 0.500-1.500.
There are four options for setting the calibration factor:
1.

Before exercise.

Select Settings > Features > Shoes/bikes > Shoe 1/2/3 > Calibrate .
Set the Calibration factor and press OK. The sensor is now calibrated.
2.

During exercise by pausing exercise recording.

Start exercising by pressing OK twice in the time display. Press STOP once and the exercise recording is
paused.
Select Settings > Calibrate > Set factor .
Set the Calibration factor and press OK. The sensor is now calibrated. Continue exercise recording by
pressing OK.
3.

During exercise without pausing exercise recording.

Start exercising by pressing OK twice in the time display. Press and hold LIGHT to get to Settings.
Select Calibrate > Set factor .

4.

Moisten the electrode area of the strap.
Attach the connector to the strap.
Tie the strap around your chest, just below the chest muscles, and attach the hook to the other end of
the strap.
Adjust the strap length to fit tightly but comfortably. Check that the moist electrode areas are firmly
against your skin and that the Polar logo of the connector is in a central and upright position.

Detach the connector from the strap and rinse the strap under running water after every use. Sweat and
moisture may keep the electrodes wet and the heart rate sensor activated. This will reduce the heart rate
sensor battery life. For more detailed washing instructions, see Care and Maintenance (page 60).

The Polar H3 heart rate sensor can be used with specific apparel that has built-in soft textile electrodes. Wet the
electrode areas of the apparel. Clip the connector of the heart rate sensor straight onto the apparel without the
strap so that the connector’s Polar logo is in an upright position.

To lock/unlock the zone, press and hold OK.
During programmed exercises: Press and hold OK and select Lock zone/Unlock zone from the Lap menu.
If, for example, you are running with a heart rate of 130 bpm which is 75% of your maximum heart rate,
and matches sport zone 3, you can press and hold OK to lock your heart rate into this zone. Sport zone3
Locked 70%-79% is displayed. An alarm sounds if you are below or above the sport zone (if the target zone
alarm function is on). Unlock the sport zone by pressing and holding OK again: Sport zone3 Unlocked is
displayed.
Using the software, you can also base ZoneLock on your speed/pace or cadence*. For further information,
see software help.

Determine Your OwnZone
For background information on Polar OwnZone®, see OwnZone Training (page 54).
Find your OwnZone in 1-5 minutes during a warm-up period by walking and jogging. You should start
exercising gently at a light intensity and gradually increase intensity to raise your heart rate.
Redefine your OwnZone:
• When changing exercise environment or exercise mode.
• When taking up exercise after more than a week’s break.
• If you are not 100 percent sure of your physical or mental state – for example, if you are not recovered
from previous training, not feeling well, or are stressed.
• After changing user settings.
Before you start to determine your OwnZone, make sure that:
• Your user settings are correct.
• You select the OwnZone exercise. Every time you start the OwnZone exercise, the training computer will
automatically determine your OwnZone.
1.
2.

Wear the heart rate sensor and stride sensor* as instructed. Start measurement by pressing OK twice.
When your exercise starts, OZ is displayed and OwnZone determination begins.

Determination of your OwnZone happens in five stages. After each stage, you will hear a beep (if the
sound settings are on) indicating the end of the stage.
OZ > Walk at a slow pace for 1 min. Keep your heart rate below 100 bpm / 50% HR max during this first

stage.
OZ >> Walk at a normal pace for 1 min. Slowly increase your heart rate by 10-20 bpm / 5% HR max.

ENGLISH

OZ >>> Walk at a brisk pace for 1 min. Increase your heart rate by 10-20 bpm / 5% HR max.
OZ >>>> Jog at a slow pace for 1 min. Increase your heart rate by 10-20 bpm / 5% HRmax.
OZ >>>>> Jog at a brisk pace or run for 1 min. Increase your heart rate by approximately 10 bpm/ 5 %

HRmax.
3.
4.

5.

At some point during the session, you will hear two consecutive beeps. This means your OwnZone has
been determined.
If determination was successful, OwnZone Updated and the zone are displayed. The zone is displayed in
beats per minute (bpm), as a percentage of maximum heart rate (HR%), or as a percentage of your heart
rate reserve (HRR%) depending on your settings.
If OwnZone determination was not successful, your previously determined OwnZone will be used and
OwnZone Limits is displayed. If OwnZone has not previously been recorded, age-based limits are
automatically applied.

You can now continue with your exercise. Try to keep inside the given heart rate zone to maximize exercise
benefits.
Alternatively, to skip OwnZone determination and use the previously determined OwnZone, press OK at
any phase of the process.

The elapsed time used for OwnZone determination is included in your exercise recording time.

7. SETTINGS
Feature Settings
A new sensor purchased as a separate accessory has to be introduced to the training computer. This is
called teaching and takes only a few seconds. Teaching ensures that your training computer receives
signals from your sensor only, and enables disturbance-free exercise in a group. If you have purchased the
sensor and the training computer as a set, the sensor has already been “taught” to work together with the
training computer. You just need to activate the sensor in your training computer.
When you activate a sensor in feature settings, Teach new sensor? is displaeyd. You can teach a new
sensor by selecting Yes. Select No if the sensor has already been taught.

To teach a separately purchased H3 heart rate sensor, see Teach a New Heart Rate Sensor (page ).

Wheel sizes on the chart are advisory as wheel size depends on the wheel type and air pressure.
Method 2
Measure the wheel manually for the most accurate result.
Use the valve to mark the point where the wheel touches the ground. Draw a line on the ground to mark
that point. Move your bike forward on a flat surface for one complete rotation. The tire should be
perpendicular to the ground. Draw another line on the ground at the valve to mark a full rotation. Measure
the distance between the two lines.
Subtract 4 mm to account for your weight on the bike to get your wheel circumference. Enter this value in
the cycling computer.

Altitude
The training computer converts measured air pressure into an altitude reading. Change the settings of the
altimeter in the Altitude menu. You can calibrate the altimeter manually or automatically.
Set the altitude function on or off
Select Settings > Features > Altitude > On / Off
Calibrating the Altitude Manually
Select Settings > Features > Altitude > Calibrate > set the altitude of current location
If the altitude of your location differs significantly from the displayed altitude value Calibrate to xx? is
displayed.
• Yes: Altitude calibrated to xx is displayed.
• No: Altitude calibration canceled is displayed. The last altitude value stored in the training computer’s
memory is applied.
Calibrate the altitude to ensure it remains accurate. Set the reference altitude whenever a reliable
reference, such as a peak or a topographic map, is available or when at sea level.
Calibrating the Altitude Automatically
Select Settings > Features > Altitude > AutoCalib > On / Off
When automatic calibration is on, the last altitude value stored in the training computer’s memory is
applied when exercising. This feature is especially useful if you always start a session in the same
environment. If automatic calibration fails, you are not in the usual environment and will need to calibrate
the altitude manually.
Altitude calibrated to xx m/ft indicates that calibration has succeeded. If Altitude calibration failed is

displayed, re-calibrate the altitude.

Recording Rate
Select Settings > Features > Rec.rate > 1 / 2 / 5 / 15 / 60 sec
The training computer can store your heart rate, speed/pace,* and altitude in 1, 2, 5, 15 or 60 second
intervals. A longer interval gives you more recording time, while a shorter interval allows you to record
more heart and other data. This enables accurate data analysis using the software.
A shorter recording rate consumes the memory of the training computer more rapidly. The remaining
recording time is displayed on the lower row when setting the rate. Default recording rate is 5 seconds.
When less than 30 minutes of maximum recording time is left, the recording rate changes automatically to
longer recording time (1s > 2s > 5s > 15s > 60s). This will maximize the time to record exercise data.
When the session ends, the current recording rate remains as default.
The following table shows the maximum recording times for each recording rate. Note that recording rate
might change when there is less than 30 minutes of recording time left.

** This is a sum of 2 or more exercises; maximum duration of a single exercise is 99 h 59 min 59 s. The
maximum recording time can be shorter, if you record a large number of short exercises.

The durations in the table are estimates. For RR data, maximum recording time depends on heart rate and
variation of heart rate. If you record laps in your exercise, and/or if you have created an exercise that includes
phases with the software, the maximum recording time will decrease.
Recording doesn't automatically stop when the memory becomes full. Therefore, exercise time may be
longer than recording time.

RR Data Function
Select Settings > Features > RR data > On / Off
The RR data recording function measures and records heartbeat variations within one millisecond
resolution. This enables the analysis (accuracy 1ms) of heart rate variability (HRV) using the software. The
RR data function consumes the memory of the training computer, therefore when setting the function, the
remaining recording time is shown on the lower row of the display.

Activity Level
Activity level is an assessment of your level of long-term physical activity. Select the alternative that best
describes the overall amount and intensity of your physical activity during the past three months.
• Top: You participate in heavy physical exercise at least 5 times a week, or you exercise to improve
performance for competitive purposes.
• High: You participate at least 3 times a week in heavy physical exercise, e.g. you run 20-50 km/12-31
miles per week or spend 3-5 hours per week in comparable physical activity.
• Moderate: You participate regularly in recreational sports, e.g. you run 5-10 km or 3-6 miles per week or
spend 1/2-2 hours per week in comparable physical activity, or your work requires modest physical
activity.
• Low: You do not participate regularly in programmed recreational sport or heavy physical activity, e.g. you
walk only for pleasure or exercise hard enough to cause heavy breathing or perspiration only occasionally.
In the training computer, these values are used to calculate your energy expenditure.
Heart Rate: HRmax, HRsit
HRmax (Maximum heart rate): Your age-predicted HR max value (220 - age) is used as a default. Set your
HRmax manually if your maximum heart rate has been determined in a lab, or if you have tested your
maximum heart rate in the field yourself.
HRsit (Heart rate value in a sitting position): Set your HRsit value if you have determined it according to
the instructions. For instructions, see Heart Rate Value in a Sitting Position (page 55).
Maximal Oxygen Intake: VO2max
VO2max is your body’s maximum capacity for oxygen consumption during maximum exertion. The most
accurate way of determining VO2max is to perform a maximal stress test in a laboratory. If you know your
exact clinically-tested VO2max, set the value in the training computer. Otherwise, measure a comparable
value, OwnIndex, by taking the Polar Fitness Test. For further information, see Polar Fitness Test TM
(page ? ).
If changes are made to the user settings, User settings updated is displayed.

You can change settings easily by using the software. For further information, see software help.

9. TESTS
Polar Fitness Test TM

The Polar Fitness Test TM is an easy, safe, and quick way to measure your aerobic (cardiovascular) fitness
at rest. The result, Polar OwnIndex, is comparable to maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), which is commonly
used to evaluate aerobic fitness. Your long-term level of physical activity, heart rate, heart rate variability
at rest, gender, age, height, and body weight all influence OwnIndex. The Polar Fitness Test is developed
for use by healthy adults.
Aerobic fitness relates to how well your cardiovascular system works to transport oxygen to your body. The
better your aerobic fitness, the stronger and more efficient your heart is. Good aerobic fitness has many
health benefits. For example, it helps in decreasing high blood pressure and your risk of cardiovascular
diseases and stroke. If you want to improve your aerobic fitness it takes, on average, six weeks of regular
training to see a noticeable change in your OwnIndex. Less fit individuals see progress even more rapidly.
The better your aerobic fitness, the smaller the improvements in your OwnIndex.
Aerobic fitness is best improved by exercise types that use large muscle groups. Such activities include
running, cycling, walking, rowing, swimming, skating, and cross-country skiing.
To monitor your progress, start by measuring your OwnIndex a couple of times during the first two weeks
in order to get a baseline value, and then repeat the test approximately once a month.
With the Polar Fitness Test, you can also calculate the predicted maximum heart rate value (HR max-p). The
HRmax-p score predicts your individual maximum heart rate more accurately than the age-based formula
(220 - age). For further information on HRmax, see User Settings (page 37).
To make sure the test results are reliable, the following basic requirements apply:
• You can perform the test anywhere - at home, at the office, at a health club - provided the testing
environment is peaceful. There should be no disturbing noises (e.g. television, radio, or telephone) and no
other people talking to you.
• Always take the test in the same environment and at the same hour.
• Avoid eating a heavy meal or smoking 2-3 hours prior to testing.
• Avoid heavy physical exertion, alcohol, and pharmacological stimulants on the test day and the previous
day.
• You should be relaxed and calm. Lie down and relax for 1-3 minutes before starting the test.

Before the Test
Wear the Heart Rate Sensor
For further information, see Wear the Heart Rate Sensor (page 13).
Enter User Information

ENGLISH

Performing the Test
Select Test > Fitness > Start > Fitness Test Lie Down
The fitness test begins in five seconds. Arrows indicate that the test is ongoing. Stay relaxed and limit
body movements and communication with other people.
If you have not set your long-term physical activity level in User Settings, Set your personal activity level
is displayed. Select Top, High, Moderate , or Low. For further information on activity levels, see User
Settings (page 37).
If your training computer does not receive your heart rate at the beginning or during the test, the test fails
and Test failed, check WearLink is displayed. Check that the heart rate sensor electrodes are wet and that
the textile strap is snug enough, and start the test again.
When the test is over, you will hear two beeps. OwnIndex is displayed with a numerical value and level
evaluation. For further information on evaluations, see Fitness Level Classes.
To display your Predicted maximum heart rate value press DOWN. Press OK to exit.
Update to VO2 max?

•
•

Select Yes to save the OwnIndex value to your user settings and Fitness Test Trend menu.
Select No only if you know your laboratory-measured VO2max value, and if it differs more than one fitness
level class from the OwnIndex result. Your OwnIndex value is saved only to the Fitness Test Trend menu.
For further information, see Fitness Test Trend .

Update to HR max? (if HRmax-p is on)

•
•

Select Yes to save the value to your user settings.
Select No if you know your laboratory-measured HRmax.

You can stop the test at any time by pressing STOP. Fitness Test canceled is displayed for a few seconds.

After saving the OwnIndex and HRmax-p values, they will be used for calculating calorie consumption.

After the Test
Fitness Level Classes
Your OwnIndex is most meaningful when comparing your individual values and changes in them over time.
OwnIndex can also be interpreted based on gender and age. Locate your OwnIndex on the table below, and
find out how your aerobic fitness compares to others of the same gender and age.
Top athletes typically score OwnIndex values above 70 (men) and 60 (women). Olympic-level endurance
athletes can reach values as high as 95. OwnIndex is highest in sports that involve large muscle groups,
such as running and cross-country skiing.

Polar OwnOptimizerTM

General
Successful training requires temporary overloading: longer exercise duration, higher intensity, or higher
total volume. In order to avoid severe overtraining, overloading must always be followed by an adequate
recovery period. With an inadequate recovery period, you may experience a decrease in performance as a
result of high training volumes, instead of improvement. Polar OwnOptimizer is an easy and reliable way to
determine whether your training program is optimally developing your performance. Polar OwnOptimizer is
developed for use by healthy adults.
Polar OwnOptimizer is a modification of a traditional orthostatic overtraining test. It is a perfect tool,
embedded in the training computer, for everyone training regularly, at least three times a week, for fitness
improvement or to reach competitive targets. This feature is based on heart rate and heart rate variability
measurements taken during an orthostatic test (standing up from relaxed resting). OwnOptimizer helps you
to optimize your training load during a training program so that you experience an increase in performance
and do not undertrain or overtrain in the long run. Polar OwnOptimizer is based on regular long-term
measurements of five heart rate parameters. Two of these five values are calculated at rest, one while
standing up, and two while standing. Each time you perform the test, the wrist unit saves the heart rate
values and compares them to the previous values registered.

Before the Test
Baseline Tests
When you use OwnOptimizer for the first time, six baseline tests should be conducted over a period of two
weeks to determine your personal baseline value. These baseline measurements should be taken during
two typical basic training weeks, not during heavy training weeks. The baseline measurements should
include tests taken after a training day and after recovery days.
Monitoring OwnOptimizer Values
After the baseline recordings, you should continue to perform the test 2-3 times a week. Test yourself
weekly in the morning following both a recovery day and a heavy training day (or a series of heavy training
days). An optional third test can be performed after a normal training day. OwnOptimizer may not provide
reliable information during detraining or in a very irregular training period. If you take a break from
exercise for 14 days or longer, the baseline tests should be performed again.

Performing the Test
The test should always be taken in standardized/similar conditions in order to get the most reliable results.
It is recommended that you take the test in the morning before breakfast. The following basic
requirements apply:
• Wear the heart rate sensor.
• You should be relaxed and calm.
• You can be seated in a relaxed position or lying in bed. The position should always be the same when you
do the test.
• The test can take place anywhere – at home, in the office, at a health club – as long as the test
environment is peaceful. There should be no disturbing noises (for example, television, radio or telephone)
or other people talking to you.
• Avoid eating, drinking and smoking 2-3 hours prior to the test.

textile strap fits snugly.

After the Test
How to Interpret Results
The wrist unit calculates five heart rate and heart rate variability based parameters. The OwnOptimizer
values are calculated by comparing your latest results to previous ones. The wrist unit will display a
written description of your training status. The descriptions are defined in detail below.
Good Recovery (1)

Your heart rate is lower than average. This indicates that you have recovered very well. You can continue
training, including intensive exercise sessions.
Normal State (2)

Your heart rate is at a normal level. Go on with your training; include both light and intensive training
sessions, and recovery days.
Training Effect (3)

Your heart rate is higher than average. You may have exercised intensively in the previous days. You have
two choices: 1) rest or train lightly for one or two days, or 2) continue intensive training for one or two
days and then recover well. Other sources of stress such as the beginning of a fever or an attack of the flu
can result in the same kind of response.
Steady State (4)

Your heart rate has continuously been at a normal level for a long time now. Effective training requires
both heavy training and good recovery, and this should cause variation in your heart rate results. Your
OwnOptimizer result indicates that you have not had very intensive training or good recovery for a while.
Perform the test again after a rest or light training day. If the recovery is effective, your result should show
Good recovery.
Stagnant State (5)

Your heart rate is still at a normal level, and this has continued for a long time. The result indicates that
your training has not been intensive enough to develop optimally. To improve your condition effectively,
you should now include more intense or longer exercise sessions in your program.
Hard Training (6)

Your heart rate has been higher than average several times. You may have trained hard on purpose. The
result indicates overloading, and you should try to recover well now. To monitor your recovery, perform the
test again after one or two resting or easy training days.
Overreaching (7)

Your OwnOptimizer result indicates that you have had a very intensive training period for several days or
weeks. Your heart rate has continuously remained at a high level. This seriously indicates that you should

Tests

49

ENGLISH

have a complete recovery period. The longer you have trained intensively, the longer the recovery period
required to recover. Perform the test again after at least two days of recovery.
Sympathetic Overtraining (8)

Your OwnOptimizer result indicates that you have had a very intensive training period for several days or
weeks, and your recovery has not been sufficient. This has resulted in a state of overtraining. To return to
a normal training state, rest for a carefully monitored recovery period. Follow your recovery by performing
the OwnOptimizer Test 2–3 times a week.
Parasympathetic Overtraining (9)

Your heart rate has stayed at a low level, which is generally interpreted as a sign of a good recovery.
However, other parameters indicate parasympathetic overtraining. You may have trained with high volumes
for a long time, and recovery may not have been sufficient. Check for other signs of overtraining, such as
decreased performance, increased fatigue, mood disturbances, sleeping problems, persistent muscle
soreness, and/or a feeling of being burnt out or stale. You may also have been subjected to other stresses.
In general, the development of parasympathetic overtraining requires a long history of heavy training
volumes. To recover from a state of parasympathetic overtraining, you have to recover body balance
completely. Recovering may take several weeks. You should not exercise, instead rest completely for most
of the recovery period. You can possibly have a few days with some light aerobic training in short sessions,
and only occasionally include short, high-intensity sessions.
You can also consider doing other than your main sport. However, it should be one you are familiar and
comfortable with. Monitor your recovery by performing the OwnOptimizer Test 2–3 times a week. Once you
feel you have recovered your body balance, and your result shows Normal State or Good recovery,
preferably more than once, you can then consider resuming training. Once you start training again, begin a
new testing period with new baseline measurements.

Before you radically change your training program, consider your OwnOptimizer results together with your
subjective feelings and any symptoms you may have. Repeat the OwnOptimizer test if you are unsure of the
standardized conditions. An individual test result can be affected by several external factors, such as mental
stress, latent illness, environmental changes (temperature, altitude), and others. You should update the baseline
calculations at least once a year, when you start a new training season.

10. USING A NEW HEART RATE SENSOR
Teach a New Heart Rate Sensor
If you purchase a new heart rate sensor, it has to be introduced to the training computer. This is called
teaching and takes only a few seconds. Teaching ensures that your training computer receives signals from
your heart rate sensor only, and enables disturbance-free exercise in a group.
In time mode, press OK > New WearLink found, Teach new WearLink?
Wear the heart rate sensor and make sure that you are not near (40 m/131 ft) other Polar H3 heart rate
sensors. In time mode, press OK. The training computer starts searching for the heart rate sensor signal.
Once the new heart rate sensor is identified, New WearLink found, Teach new WearLink? is displayed.
• Select YES to confirm teaching. Completed! is displayed. Start exercise recording by pressing OK.
• Select NO to cancel teaching.
To return to time mode, press and hold the STOP button.

11. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Polar Sport Zones
Polar sport zones introduce a new level of effectiveness in heart rate-based training. Training is divided
into five sport zones based on percentages of maximum heart rate. With sport zones, you can easily select
and monitor training intensities.

Training benefit

HRmax = Maximum heart rate (220-age). Example: 30 years old, 220–30=190 bpm.
Exercising in sport zone 1 is done at a very low intensity. The main training principle is that performance
improves when recovering after, and not only during, training. Accelerate the recovery process with very
light intensity training.
Sport zone 2 is for endurance training, an essential part of any training program. Exercise sessions in this
zone are easy and aerobic. Long-duration training in this light zone results in effective energy expenditure.
Progress will require persistence.
Aerobic power is enhanced in sport zone 3. The training intensity is higher than in sport zones 1 and 2,

Background Information

53

ENGLISH

but still mainly aerobic. Training in sport zone 3 may, for example, consist of intervals followed by
recovery. Exercising in this zone is especially effective for improving the efficiency of blood circulation in
the heart and skeletal muscles.
If your goal is to compete at top potential, you will have to train in sport zones 4 and 5. In these zones,
you exercise anaerobically, in intervals of up to 10 minutes. The shorter the interval, the higher the
intensity. Sufficient recovery between intervals is very important. The training pattern in zones 4 and 5 is
designed to produce peak performance.
The Polar sport zones can be personalized by using a laboratory measured HRmax value, or by taking a field
test to measure the value yourself. When exercising in a sport zone, try to make use of the entire zone. The
mid-zone is a good target, but keeping your heart rate at that exact level all the time is not necessary.
Heart rate gradually adjusts to training intensity. For instance, when crossing from sport zone 1 to 3, the
circulatory system and heart rate will adjust in 3-5 minutes.
Heart rate responds to exercise intensity depending on factors such as fitness and recovery levels, as well
as environmental factors. It is important to look out for subjective feelings of fatigue, and to adjust your
training program accordingly.
A simple way of making use of the sport zones is to work with target heart rate zones. For further
instructions, see Plan Your Training (page 9).
After the exercise, exercise duration is displayed in sport zones. Access the Weekly display to see in which
sport zones you have been exercising, and for how long.
The Polar ProTrainer 5 offers up to 10 sport zones to better serve your training needs and heart rate
reserve.

OwnZone Training
Your training computer determines automatically an individual and safe exercise intensity zone: your
OwnZone. The unique Polar OwnZone defines your personal training zone for aerobic training. The function
guides you through your warm-up, and takes your present physical and mental condition into account. For
most adults, OwnZone corresponds to 65-85% of maximum heart rate.
OwnZone can be determined in 1-5 minutes during a warm-up period by walking, jogging, or doing some
other sport. The idea is to start exercising slowly at a light intensity, and to gradually increase intensity
and heart rate. OwnZone is developed for use by healthy people. Some health conditions may cause heart
rate variability-based OwnZone determination to fail. These conditions include high blood pressure,
cardiac arrhythmias, and certain medications.
Listening to and interpreting the signals your body sends during physical exertion is an important part of
getting fit. Since warm-up routines differ for different types of exercise, and since your physical and
mental state may also vary from day to day (due to stress or illness), using the OwnZone function for every
session guarantees the most effective heart rate target zone for that particular type of exercise and day.

Maximum Heart Rate
Maximum heart rate (HRmax) is the highest number of heartbeats per minute (bpm) during maximum
physical exertion. It is individual and depends on age, hereditary factors, and fitness level. It may also
vary according to the type of sport performed. HRmax is used to express exercise intensity.
Determining Maximum Heart Rate
Your HR max can be determined in several ways.
• The most accurate way is to have your HRmax clinically measured, usually on a maximal treadmill or by
taking a bicycle stress test supervised by a cardiologist or exercise physiologist.
• You can also determine your HR max by taking a field test together with a training partner.
• You can obtain a HR max-p score that predicts your HRmax by taking a Polar Fitness Test.
• HRmax can also be estimated by using the commonly used formula: 220 - age, although research shows
that the method is not very accurate, especially for older persons or those who have been fit for many

54

Background Information

ENGLISH

years.
If you have done some hard training in recent weeks and know that you can safely reach maximum heart
rate, you can safely take a test to determine your HRmax yourself. Having a training buddy with you during
the test is recommended. If you are uncertain, consult your physician before undertaking the test.
Here is an example of a simple test.
Step 1: Warm up for 15 minutes on a flat surface, building up to your usual training pace.
Step 2: Choose a hill or stairwell that will take more than 2 minutes to climb. Run up the hill/steps once,
building to as hard a pace as you can hold for 20 minutes. Return to the base of the hill/steps.
Step 3: Run up the hill/steps again, building towards a pace you could just about hold for 3 kilometers.
Note your highest heart rate. Your maximum is approximately 10 beats higher than the noted value.
Step 4: Run back down the hill, allowing your heart rate to drop 30-40 beats per minute.
Step 5: Run up the hill/steps once again at a pace that you can only hold for 1 minute. Try to run halfway
up the hills/steps. Note your highest heart rate. This brings you close to your maximum heart rate. Use this
value as your maximum heart rate to set training zones.
Step 6: Make sure you get a good cool-down, a minimum of 10 minutes.

Heart Rate Value in a Sitting Position
HRsit is your average heart rate when completely still (i.e. while sitting). To easily determine HR sit, wear
your heart rate sensor, sit down, and do not engage in any physical activity. For a more precise
measurement, repeat the procedure several times and calculate your average.

Heart Rate Reserve
Heart rate reserve (HRR) is the difference between maximum heart rate (HRmax), and resting heart rate
(HRrest)*. HRR is used to calculate exercise heart rates. It is the range within which heart rate varies
depending on exertion level. HRR equals oxygen uptake reserve (VO2R).
Exercise heart rate can be determined by using the Karvonen formula**. Add the given percentage of heart
rate reserve to resting heart rate.
Exercise HR = % of target intensity (HRmax – HRrest) + HRrest
Example:
Target intensity 70 % HRR for a person with HR max 201 bpm and HRrest 50 bpm
Exercise HR= 70% (201-50) + 50
Exercise HR=156 bpm
For a precise exercise heart rate, you need your exact HRmax and HRrest. When using estimated HRmax,
exercise heart rate values are always estimates.
*In Polar RS800CX training computer, the heart rate value during a resting state is measured in a sitting
position (HRsit). This is for practical reasons since HRsit is used in energy expenditure calculation because
of accuracy. HR sit matches the low intensity to which different exercise intensities can be compared.
**Karvonen M, Kentala K, Mustala O. The effects of training on heart rate: a longitudinal study. Ann Med
Exp Biol Fenn 1957; 35: 307-315.

Heart Rate Variability
Heart rate varies with every heartbeat. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the variation of beat to beat intervals,
also known as R-R intervals.

Background Information

55

ENGLISH

HRV indicates the fluctuations of heart rate around an average heart rate. An average heart rate of 60
beats per minute (bpm) does not mean that the interval between successive heartbeats would be exactly
1.0 sec, instead they may fluctuate/vary from 0.5 sec up to 2.0 sec.
HRV is affected by aerobic fitness. HRV of a well-conditioned heart is generally large at rest. Other factors
that affect HRV are age, genetics, body position, time of day, and health status. During exercise, HRV
decreases as heart rate and exercise intensity increase. HRV also decreases during periods of mental
stress.
HRV is regulated by the autonomic nervous system. Parasympathetic activity decreases heart rate and
increases HRV, whereas sympathetic activity increases heart rate and decreases HRV.
HRV is used in the Ownzone, OwnIndex, and in OwnOptimizer features. It can also be monitored on its
own using the training computer. If your HRV changes at a given pace and heart rate, this may indicate a
change in your training load and stress.

Running Cadence and Stride Length
Cadence* is the number of times the foot with the stride sensor* hits the ground per minute.
Stride length* is the average length of one step. That is the distance between your right and left foot
contacting the ground.
Running speed = 2 * stride length * cadence
There are two ways to run faster: moving your legs at a higher cadence or taking longer steps.
Elite long distance runners typically run with a high cadence of 85-95. On uphills, typical cadence values
are lower. On downhills they are higher. Runners adjust stride length to gather speed: stride length
increases as speed increases.
Yet one of the most common mistakes novice runners make is over-striding. The most efficient stride
length is the natural one – the one that feels most comfortable. You will run faster in races by
strengthening your leg muscles so they take you forward with a longer stride.
You should also work on maximizing cadence efficiency. Cadence does not progress easily, but if properly
trained, you will be able to sustain it throughout your runs and maximize your performance. To develop
cadence, the nerve-muscle connection needs to be trained - and reasonably frequently. A session of
cadence training a week is a good start. Incorporate some cadence work into the rest of your week. During
long easy runs, you could include some faster cadence every now and then.
When training for longer running events (½ Marathon, Marathon or longer), it may be helpful to monitor
cadence. A low cadence at expected race pace can cause problems later in the event, as your legs tire.

56

Background Information

ENGLISH

One way around this is to work on increasing leg speed at expected race pace. You can set your training
computer to show pace and cadence. Try to shorten your stride and increase cadence while holding the
same pace (set a narrow pace zone to give you audio feedback).You can aim to raise running cadence
above the following:
• 80/min (4hour Marathoners)
• 85/min (3hr 30min Marathoners)
• 88/min (3hour Marathoners)
This is a general guide only, taller runners will naturally have slightly lower cadences. Runners should also
tune in to what feels comfortable for them personally.
A good way of improving stride length is to undertake specific strength work, like running hills, running in
soft sand, or running up steps. A six-week training period including strength work should result in
noticeable improvements in stride length, and if combined with some faster leg speed work (such as short
strides at best 5km pace), noticeable improvements should be seen in overall speed, as well.
*Optional s3/s3+ stride sensor W.I.N.D. required.

R-R Recording
R-R recording rate saves heartbeat intervals, i.e. intervals between successive heartbeats. This information
is also shown as instantaneous heart rate in beats per minute in recorded samples.
When recording every single interval, extra systoles and artefacts can also be seen. We recommend using
contact gel (ECG gel) to optimize contact between your skin and the heart rate sensor. Readings
interpreted as incorrect in the heart rate data can be adjusted and corrected with the software.

Polar Running Index
Running Index offers an easy way to monitor performance changes. Performance (how fast/easily you run
at a given pace) is directly influenced by aerobic fitness (VO2max) and exercise economy (how efficient
your body is at running), and Running Index is a measurement of this influence. By recording your
Running Index over time, you can monitor progress. Improvement means that running at a given pace
requires less of an effort, or that your pace is faster at a given level of exertion. The Running Index feature
calculates such improvements. Running Index also gives you daily information on your running
performance level which may vary from day to day.
Benefits of Running Index:
• emphasizes the positive effects of good training sessions and resting days.
• monitors fitness and performance development at different heart rate levels - not only during maximal
performance.
• you can determine your optimal running speed by comparing running indexes from different kinds of
trainings.
• stresses progress through better running technique and fitness level.
Running Index is calculated during every exercise when heart rate and the s3/s3+ stride sensor/ G3/G5
GPS sensor* signal is recorded, and when the following requirements apply:
• speed should be 6km/h / 3,75 mi/h or faster and duration 12 minutes minimum.
• heart rate should be above 40% HRmax.
Make sure that the stride sensor is calibrated. Calculation begins when you start recording the session.
During the session, you may stop once at traffic lights, for example, without interrupting the calculation.
In the end, your training computer displays a Running Index value and stores the result in the File section.
Compare your result to the table below. Using the software, you can monitor and analyze your progress in
Running Index values against time and different running speeds. Or compare values from different
exercise sessions and analyze them in the short and long term.

Precautions
Interference During Exercise
Electromagnetic Interference and Exercise Equipment
Disturbance may occur near microware ovens and computers. Also WLAN base stations may cause
interference when exercising with RS800CX. To avoid erratic reading or misbehaviors, move away from
possible sources of disturbance.
Exercise equipment with electronic or electrical components such as LED displays, motors and electrical
brakes may cause interfering stray signals. To solve these problems, try the following:
1.
2.

3.

Remove the heart rate sensor from your chest and use the exercise equipment as you would normally.
Move the training computer around until you find an area in which it displays no stray reading or does not
flash the heart symbol. Interference is often worst directly in front of the display panel of the equipment,
while the left or right side of the display is relatively free of disturbance.
Put the heart rate sensor back on your chest and keep the training computer in this interference-free area
as much as possible.

If the training computer still does not work with the exercise equipment, it may be electrically too noisy
for wireless heart rate measurement.
Using RS800 Training Computer in Water
The training computer is water resistant. However, heart rate measurement does not work in water. You
can use the training computer under water as a watch but it is not a diving instrument. To maintain water
resistance, do not press the buttons of the training computer under water. Using the training computer in
excessive rainfall may also cause interference.

Minimizing Risks When Exercising
Exercise may include some risk. Before beginning a regular exercise program, it is recommended that you
answer the following questions concerning your health status. If you answer yes to any of these questions,
we recommend that you consult a doctor before starting any training program.
• Have you been physically inactive for the past 5 years?
• Do you have high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol?
• Are you taking any blood pressure or heart medication?
• Do you have a history of breathing problems?
• Do you have symptoms of any disease?
• Are you recovering from a serious illness or medical treatment?

62

Customer Service Information

ENGLISH

•
•
•

Do you use a pacemaker or other implanted electronic device?
Do you smoke?
Are you pregnant?

Note that in addition to exercise intensity, medications for heart conditions, blood pressure, psychological
conditions, asthma, breathing, etc., as well as some energy drinks, alcohol, and nicotine may also affect
heart rate.
It is important to be sensitive to your body’s responses during exercise. If you feel unexpected pain or
excessive fatigue when exercising, it is recommended that you stop the exercise or continue at a lighter
intensity.
Note! If you are using a pacemaker, you can use Polar training computers. In theory interference to
pacemaker caused by Polar products should not be possible. In practice no reports exist to suggest anyone
ever having experienced interference. We cannot however issue an official guarantee on our products'
suitability with all pacemakers or other implanted devices due to the variety of devices available. If you
have any doubts, or if you experience any unusual sensations while using Polar products, please consult
your physician or contact the implanted electronic device manufacturer to determine safety in your case.
If you are allergic to any substance that comes into contact with your skin or if you suspect an allergic
reaction due to using the product, check the listed materials in Technical Specifications. To avoid any
skin reaction to the heart rate sensor, wear it over a shirt, but moisten the shirt well under the electrodes
to ensure flawless operation.
Your safety is important to us. The shape of the s3/s3+ stride sensor* is designed to minimize the
possibility of it getting caught in something. In any case, be careful when running with the stride sensor in
brushwood, for example.

The combined impact of moisture and intense abrasion may cause a black color to come off the heart rate sensor’s
surface, possibly staining light-colored clothes. If you use insect repellent on your skin, you must ensure that it
does not come into contact with the heart rate sensor.
*Optional s3/s3+ stride sensor W.I.N.D. required.

...there are no reactions to any buttons?
Reset the training computer by pressing all the buttons simultaneously for two seconds until the display
fills with digits. Press any button and set the time and date in Basic Settings after the reset. All other
settings are saved. Skip the rest of the settings by pressing and holding STOP.
...the heart rate reading becomes erratic, extremely high or shows nil (00)?
• Make sure the heart rate sensor strap has not loosened during exercise.
• Make sure the textile electrodes in the sports apparel fit snugly.
• Make sure that the electrodes of the heart rate sensor / sports apparel are moistened.
• Make sure the heart rate sensor / sports apparel is clean.
• Strong electromagnetic signals can cause erratic readings. For further information, see Precautions
(page 62).
• If the erratic heart rate reading continues despite moving away from the source of disturbance, slow down
your speed and check your pulse manually. If you feel it corresponds to the high reading on the display,
you may be experiencing cardiac arrhythmia. Most cases of arrhythmia are not serious, but consult your
doctor nevertheless.
• A cardiac event may have altered your ECG waveform. In this case, consult your physician.
…Memory full is displayed?
The message appears during exercise if you have recorded 99 laps or if no memory space is left for the
exercise. In that case, stop recording the exercise and transfer the exercise files from your training
computer to the Polar ProTrainer 5. Then delete them from the training computer.
…Check WearLink! is displayed and your training computer cannot find your heart rate signal?
• Make sure the heart rate sensor strap has not loosened during exercise.
• Make sure the textile electrodes in sports apparel fit snugly.
• Make sure that the electrodes of the heart rate sensor / sports apparel are moistened.
• Make sure the heart rate sensor / electrodes in the sports apparel are clean and undamaged.
• If the heart rate measurement does not work with the sports apparel, try using a heart rate sensor strap. If
your heart rate is detected with the strap, the problem is most probably in the apparel. Please contact the
apparel retailer / manufacturer.
• If you have done all of the above-mentioned actions, and the message still appears and heart rate
measurement does not work, the battery of your heart rate sensor may be empty. For further information,
see Care and Maintenance (page 60).
…New WearLink found. Teach new WearLink? is displayed?
If you have purchased a new heart rate sensor as an accessory, it will have to be introduced to the training
computer. For further information, see Teach a New Heart Rate Sensor (page ).
If the heart rate sensor you are using is included in the product set, and the text appears on the display,
the training computer may be detecting the signal of another heart rate sensor. In that case, make sure
you are wearing your own heart rate sensor, that the electrodes are moistened, and that the heart rate
sensor strap has not loosened. If the message still appears, the battery of your heart rate sensor is empty.
For further information, see Care and Maintenance (page 60).
...S sensor calibration failed is displayed?*
Calibration did not succeed and you need to re-calibrate. Calibration fails if you move during the process.
Once you reach lap distance, stop running and stand still for calibration. The range of the calibration
factor during manual calibration is 0.500-1.500. If you have defined the calibration factor below or above
