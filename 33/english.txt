39

3D IMAGING
This TV can display in 3D via 3D broadcasting or when the TV is connected to a compatible device, such
as a Blu-ray 3D Player. The viewer must wear compatible 3D glasses in order to see these images in 3D
format.

NOTE
After powering on the TV, a few seconds may be needed for your TV to calibrate.
yy
When watching digital TV in 3D imaging mode, TV out signals cannot be output through the SCART
yy
cable.
If 3D TV broadcast standard changes in the future and it is not supported by this TV, you may need a
yy
separate device, such as a set-top box.

Cleaning Your TV
Clean your TV regularly to keep the best performance and to extend the product lifespan.

CAUTION
Make sure to turn the power off and disconnect the power cord and all other cables first.
yy
When the TV is left unattended and unused for a long time, disconnect the power cord from the wall
yy
outlet to prevent possible damage from lightning or power surges.

Screen and frame
To remove dust, wipe the surface with a dry and soft cloth.
To remove major dirt, wipe the surface with a soft cloth dampened in clean water or a diluted mild
detergent. Then wipe immediately with a clean and dry cloth.

CAUTION
Do not push, rub, or hit the surface with your fingernail or a sharp object, as this may result in
yy
scratches on the screen and image distortions.
Do not use any chemicals, such as waxes, benzene, alcohol, thinners, insecticides, air fresheners,
yy
lubricants, as these may damage the screen’s finish and cause discolorations.

Cabinet and stand
To remove dust, wipe the cabinet with a dry and soft cloth.
To remove major dirt, wipe the cabinet with a soft cloth dampened in a clean water or water containing a
small amount of mild detergent.

CAUTION
Do not spray liquid onto the surface. If water enters the TV, it may result in fire, electric shock, or
yy
malfunction.
Do not use any chemicals as this may deteriorate the surface.

Preventing “Image burn” or “Burn-in” on your TV screen
ENGLISH

If a fixed image displays on the TV screen for a long period of time, it will be imprinted and become
yy
a permanent disfigurement on the screen. This is “image burn” or “burn-in” and not covered by the
warranty.
If the aspect ratio of the TV is set to 4:3 for a long period of time, image burn may occur on the
yy
letterboxed area of the screen.
Avoid displaying a fixed image on the TV screen for a long period of time (2 or more hours for LCD)
yy
to prevent image burn.

IF THE QUALITY OF THE 3D IMAGE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, CHECK THE FOLLOWING

ENGLISH

IF THE QUALITY OF THE 3D IMAGE IS NOT
ACCEPTABLE, CHECK THE FOLLOWING
1) Viewing distance
	 For optimal 3D viewing distance, please see the table below.
	 Please maintain the optimal viewing distance for the best 3D experience.
2) Viewing angle
	 For optimal 3D viewing angles, see the table below.
3) Check the 3D display sequence (L-R, R-L)
	 The display method may vary due to the 3D content type. Try changing the display method to L-R or
R-L for a better viewing experience

Remain at the optimal viewing
distance from the Cinema 3D
TV.

Adjust the Cinema 3D TV
angle and your position to
achieve the optimal viewing
angle.

Adjust the position of the screen
to minimise reflections.

Keep your lower arms

VIEWING 3D IMAGING
Viewing Environment
yy Viewing Time
-- When watching 3D contents, take 5 - 15 minute breaks every hour. Viewing 3D contents for a long
period of time may cause headache, dizziness, fatigue or eye strain.
Viewing Age
yy Infants/Children
-- Usage/ Viewing 3D contents for children under the age of 6 are prohibited.
-- Children under the age of 10 may overreact and become overly excited because their vision is in
development (for example: trying to touch the screen or trying to jump into it. Special monitoring
and extra attention is required for children watching 3D contents.
- Children have greater binocular disparity of 3D presentations than adults because the distance
between the eyes is shorter than one of adults. Therefore they will perceive more stereoscopic
depth compared to adults for the same 3D image.
y
Teenagers
y
-- Teenagers under the age of 19 may react with sensitivity due to stimulation from light in 3D
contents. Advise them to refrain from watching 3D contens for a long time when they are tired.
y
Elderly
y
-- The elderly may perceive less 3D effect compared to the youth. Do not sit closer to the TV than the
recommended distance.
Those that have a photosensitive seizure or chronic illness
yy Some users may experience a seizure or other abnormal symptoms when they are exposed to a
flashing light or particular pattern from 3D contents.
yy Do not watch 3D videos if you feel nausea, are pregnant and/ or have a chronic illness such as epilepsy,
cardiac disorder, or blood pressure disease, etc.
yy 3D Contents are not recommended to those who suffer from stereo blindness or stereo anomaly.
Double images or discomfort in viewing may be experienced.
yy If you have strabismus (cross-eyed), amblyopia (weak eyesight) or astigmatism, you may have trouble
sensing depth and easily feel fatigue due to double images. It is advised to take frequent breaks than
the average adult.
yy If your eyesight varies between your right and left eye, revise your eyesight prior to watching 3D
contents.
Symptoms which require discontinuation or refraining from watching 3D contents
yy Do not watch 3D contents when you feel fatigue from lack of sleep, overwork or drinking.
yy When these symptoms are experienced, stop using/watching 3D contents and get enough rest until
the symptom subsides.
-- Consult your doctor when the symptoms persist. Symptoms may include headache, eyeball pain,
dizziness, nausea, palpitation, blurriness, discomfort, double image, visual inconvenience or fatigue.

CAUTION
ENGLISH

Viewing Environment
yy 	Viewing Distance
-	 Maintain a distance of at least twice the screen diagonal length when watching 3D contents. If you
feel discomfort in viewing 3D contents, move further away from the TV.

Cautions when using the 3D glasses
yy 	Make sure to use LG 3D glasses. Otherwise, you may not be able to view 3D videos properly.
yy 	Do not use 3D glasses instead of your normal glasses, sunglasses or protective goggles.
yy 	Using modified 3D glasses may cause eye strain or image distortion.
yy 	Do not keep your 3D glasses in extremely high or low temperatures. It will cause deformation.
yy 	The 3D glasses are fragile and are easy to be scratched. Always use a soft, clean piece of cloth when
wiping the lenses. Do not scratch the lenses of the 3D glasses with sharp objects or clean/wipe them
with chemicals.

15 minutes of inactivity.

Using 3D mode
Problem

Resolution

If you can see a swirling oil-like
pattern on the TV when the TV is
turned off.

This is caused by the interference of external light in the air layer between the
LCD surface and 3D filter. The pattern becomes almost invisible when you turn
on the power again.

If you are not using the glasses
provided with the TV.

When you view 3D images with this TV, it is very important that you use the
glasses provided with the TV. The glasses are designed to compensate optically
for the 3D filter attached to the surface of the TV. If you wear third-party glasses,
you may not see 3D images properly on the TV.

If you view 3D images outside the
optimal viewing angle or distance.

The optimal viewing angle of this TV is between 12° degrees; the optimal viewing
distance is between 50 cm to 150 cm from the TV. When you view 3D images
outside the optimal viewing angle or viewing distance, the images may look
overlapped or not be displayed properly in 3D.

Notes for Viewing 3D Image with 3D Digital Brodcating
*In Analogue Brodcating, 3D Imaging does not work.
Problem
When switching the 2D image
display to the 3D image display
with the 3D button on the remote
control, the overlapped image may
be displayed.

There may be interference relating to resolution, vertical pattern, contrast or brightness in PC mode.
yy
Change the PC mode to another resolution or change the refresh rate to another rate or adjust the

If using a sound card, adjust PC sound as required.
yy
If the graphic card on the PC does not output analogue and digital RGB simultaneously, connect only

one of either RGB or HDMI/DVI IN to display the PC output on the TV.
If the graphic card on the PC does output analogue and digital RGB simultaneously, set the TV to
