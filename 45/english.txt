Introduction

About the internal Hard Disk
Drive
The internal hard disk drive (HDD) is a fragile piece of
equipment. Please use the recorder following the
guidelines below to protect against possible HDD
failure.
We recommend that you back up your important
recordings onto DVD discs in order to protect against
accidental loss.


Do not move the recorder while it is on.



Install and use the recorder on a stable, level
surface.



Do not use the recorder in excessively hot or humid
places, or in places that may be subject to sudden
changes in temperature. Sudden changes in
temperature can cause condensation to form inside
the recorder. This can be a cause of HDD failure.



While the recorder is switched on, do not unplug
from the wall socket or switch the electricity off from
the breaker switch.



Do not move the recorder immediately after
switching it off. If you need to move the recorder,
please follow the steps below:
1. After the message OFF is shown in the display,
wait at least two minutes.
2. Unplug from the wall socket.
3. Move the recorder.



If there’s a power failure while the recorder is on
there is a chance that some data on the HDD will
be lost.



The HDD is very delicate. If used improperly or in
an unsuitable environment, it is possible that the
HDD will fail after a few years of use. Signs of
problems include playback unexpectedly freezing
and noticeable block noise (mosaic) in the picture.
However, sometimes there will be no warning signs
of HDD failure.
If the HDD fails, no playback of recorded material
will be possible. In this case it will be necessary to
replace the HDD unit.

Digital Multi-channel sound
A digital multi-channel connection provides the best
sound quality. For this you need a multi-channel
Audio/Video receiver that supports one or more of the
audio formats supported by your recorder (MPEG 2,
Dolby Digital and DTS). Check the receiver manual
and the logos on the front of the receiver.
Caution:
Due to the DTS Licensing agreement, the digital
output will be in DTS digital out when DTS audio
stream is selected.
Notes:
• If the audio format of the digital output does not
match the capabilities of your receiver, the receiver
will produce a strong, distorted sound or no sound
at all.
• Six Channel Digital Surround Sound via digital
connection can only be obtained if your receiver is
equipped with a Digital Multi-channel decoder.
• To see the audio format of the current DVD in the
on-screen display, press AUDIO.
• This recorder does not perform internal (2 channel)
decoding of a DTS sound track. To enjoy DTS
multi channel surround, you must connect this
recorder to a DTS compatible receiver via one of
this recorder’s digital audio outputs.

 Our company takes no responsibility for recording
failure due to power outages, defective discs, or

Disc types and recording formats, modes,
and settings
This recorder can play various kinds of DVD discs:
pre-recorded DVD-Video discs, DVD-RW,
DVD-R, DVD+RW and DVD+R discs. The disc format
for DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD+RW discs is always “Video
format”—the same as pre-recorded DVD-Video discs.
This means that once finalized, you can play a
DVD-R, DVD+R, or DVD+RW in a regular DVD
player.
By default, the DVD-RW disc format is Video format,
though you can change this to Video Recording (VR)
format, if required. (Reinitializing the disc will erase
the contents of the disc.)
The recording mode is closely related to the disc
format. If the disc format is Video Recording format,
then the recording mode is VR mode; if the disc
format is Video mode, then the recording mode is
Video mode (except for DVD-Video, which is not
recordable, and so does not have a recording mode).
Within the recording modes (which are fixed for them
whole disc) are the record settings. These can be
changed as required for each recording and
determine the picture quality and how much space the
recording will take up on the disc.

About HDD recording
Recording to the internal hard disk drive (HDD) is
basically similar to recording to a VR mode DVD-RW
disc. You have the full choice of recording quality
options, including the manual mode, and of course
you can record, erase and re-record as many times as
you like. The capacity of the hard disk drive means
that you can store many hours of video on it, even in
the higher quality recording modes. To help you
organize the contents, the HDD is divided into ten
genre. You can name and use these genres as you
like—for example, you might have a genre for movies,
another for TV shows, and one for camcorder
recordings.



The recording times shown are not exact because
the recorder uses variable bit-rate video
compression. This means that the exact recording
time will depend on the material being recorded.
When recording a TV broadcast, if the reception is
poor or the picture contains interference, the
recording times may be shorter.
If you record still pictures or audio only, the
recording time may be longer.
The displayed times for recording and time
remaining may not always add up to exactly the
length of the disc.
The recording time available may decrease if you
heavily edit a disc.
If using a DVD-RW disc, make sure you change the
recording format (Video mode or VR mode) before
you record anything on the disc. See page 20 (Disc
Format) for how to do this.
When using a DVD-R or DVD+R disc, you can keep
recording until the disc is full, or until you finalize the
disc. Before you start a recording session, check
the amount of recording time left on the disc.
When using a DVD-RW disc in Video mode,
recording time available will only increase if you
erase the last title recorded on the disc.
The Delete Title option in the Title List (Original)
menu only hides the title, it does not actually erase
the title from the disc and increase the recording
time available (except for the last recorded title on a
DVD-RW disc in Video mode).
When using a DVD+R/RW, the recorder will execute
the Menu-making operation to update the new title
and editing when removing the disc from the recorder
or turn off the recorder. So you must remove the disc
after selecting the recorder’s operation mode to DVD
mode.
This unit can record TV program to HDD only. If you
try to record TV program in DVD mode, the unit
automatically change the mode to HDD then start
recording.

Title List and Chapter List Menu
Overview
Using the Title List menu you can edit video content.
The editing features available in the Title List menu
depend on whether you are editing video on DVD, or
the HDD, and whether you’re editing Original content,
or a Playlist.
There are two ways to edit VR mode DVD-RW discs.
You can directly edit the Original content of the disc,
or you can create and edit a Playlist. The Playlist
doesn’t actually change any of the content on the
disc, but just controls how the content is played back.
Editing material recorded on the HDD is similar to
editing the Original content of a VR mode DVD-RW,
with similar commands for erasing and naming titles,
as well as fine control over the content of chapters
within titles for DVD disc.
Note:
During recording, if you display the Title List menu for
the HDD, some of the titles may appear with a mark.
These titles were recorded with a Line Input setting
different to the current setting of the recorder.
During recording, these titles cannot be played.
1. Press MENU/LIST to display the Title List menu.
Playback should be stopped when you do this.

You can also access it using HOME menu,
select [MOVIE] option then select [HDD] or

The main part of the screen shows thumbnails of the
titles (or chapter) on the DVD or HDD. You can
change these thumbnails using the THUMBNAIL
button—see Changing Title Thumbnails on page 39.
Press DISPLAY to display the information of selected
title on the Title List menu.
After selecting a title or chapter on the Title List or
Chapter List menu, then press ENTER. The menu
options appears on the left side of the menu. Use

Titles, Chapters and Parts
Titles in the disc’s original content contain one or
more chapters. When you insert a disc’s title into the
Playlist, all the chapters within that title also appear. In
other words, chapters in the Playlist behave exactly as
chapters on a DVD-Video disc do. Parts are sections
of Original or Playlist titles. From the Original and
Playlist menu you can add or delete parts. Adding a
chapter or title to the Playlist creates a new title made
up of a section (ie., chapter) of an Original title.
Deleting a part removes part of a title from the
Original or Playlist menu.
Caution
 When editing using the Delete, Add and Move
functions, the start and end frames may not be
exactly as set in the start and end point display.
 During Playlist playback, you may notice a
momentary pause between edits. This is not a
malfunction.

Is editing a DVD like editing a video
tape?
No. When you edit a video tape you need one video
deck to play the original tape and another to record
the edits. With DVD, you edit by making a ‘Playlist’ of
what to play and when to play it. On playback, the
Recorder plays the disc according to the Playlist.

Playing Your Recordings on Other DVD
Players (Finalizing a Disc)

Additional Information

Most regular DVD players can play finalized discs
recorded in Video mode, finalized DVD+R or
DVD+RWs. A small number of players can also play
DVD-RW discs recorded in VR mode, finalized or not.
Check the manual that came with the other player to
check what formats of discs it will play.

Viewing Title List menu displayed on
other DVD Recorders or Players
+RW
+R
You can view the Title List menu displayed on the
other DVD player that is capable of playing DVD+RW
or DVD+R discs.
1. Insert DVD+R or DVD+RW disc recorded already.
2. Press TITLE in play or stop mode.
Title List menu will appear as shown below.
Tip
You can remove the Title List menu by pressing

Finalizing ‘fixes’ the recordings and editings in place
so that the disc can be played on a regular DVD
player or computer equipped with a suitable DVDROM drive.
Finalizing a Video mode disc creates a menu screen
for navigating the disc. The menu can be accessed by
pressing MENU/LIST or TITLE.
To finalize a disc, refer to “Finalize” on page 21.
Notes:
Unfinalized DVD+RW is playable on regular DVD
players.
 The edited contents of a DVD+RW disc is
compatible on regular DVD players only after
finalization.
 Any edited contents of the DVD+R disc are not
compatible on regular DVD players. (Hide, chapter
combine, added chapter mark, etc.)
 How long finalization takes depends on the type of
disc, how much is recorded on the disc, and the
number of titles on the disc.

3. To play back a title, select the title you want then
press ENTER or PLAY (N).
