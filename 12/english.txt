About RDS
This unit is equipped with RDS (Radio Data
System), which brings a wide range of
information to FM radio. Now in use in many
countries, RDS is a system for transmitting
station call signs or network information, a
description of station programme type text
message about the station or specifics of musical
selection and the correct time.

RDS Tuning
When a FM station is tuned in and it contains
RDS data, the unit will automatically display the
station’s call sign and the RDS indicator will light
in the Display Window as well as indicators for
the programme type recognition (PTY), Radio
Text (RT), Clock Time (CT) and RDS services
programme (PS) if transmitted by the station.

RDS Display Options
The RDS system is capable of transmitting a
wide variety of information in addition to the initial
call sign that appears when a station is first
tuned. In normal RDS operation the display will
indicate the station name, broadcast network or
call letters. Pressing RDS on the remote control
enables you to cycle through the various data
types in the sequence:
(FREQUENCY → PTY → RT → CT → PS )

Programme Search (PTY)
A major benefit of RDS is its ability to encode
broadcasts with Programme Type (PTY) codes
that indicate the type of material being broadcast.
The following list shows the abbreviations used to
indicate each PTY along with an explanation of
the PTY.
