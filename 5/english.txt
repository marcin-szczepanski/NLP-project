it may not play because of the settings of
the application software used to create the
disc. (Check with the software publisher for
more detailed information.)
yy This player requires discs and recordings to
meet certain technical standards in order to
achieve optimal playback quality.
yy Pre-recorded DVDs are automatically set to

packing materials. If you need to ship the unit, for
maximum protection, re-pack the unit as it was
originally packed at the factory.
Keeping the exterior surfaces clean

Cleaning the unit
To clean the player, use a soft, dry cloth. If the
surfaces are extremely dirty, use a soft cloth lightly
moistened with a mild detergent solution. Do not
use strong solvents such as alcohol, benzine, or
thinner, as these might damage the surface of the
unit.
yy Do not use volatile liquids such as insecticide
spray near the unit.

Do not touch the playback side of the disc. Hold
the disc by the edges so that fingerprints do not
get on the surface. Never stick paper or tape on the
disc.

Storing Discs
After playing, store the disc in its case. Do not
expose the disc to direct sunlight or sources of heat
and never leave it in a parked car exposed to direct
sunlight.

Cleaning Discs
Fingerprints and dust on the disc can cause poor
picture quality and sound distortion. Before playing,
clean the disc with a clean cloth. Wipe the disc from
the center to out.
Do not use strong solvents such as alcohol,
benzine, thinner, commercially available cleaners,
or anti-static spray intended for older vinyl records.

yy Wiping with strong pressure may damage the
surface.
yy Do not leave rubber or plastic products in
contact with the unit for a long period of time.
