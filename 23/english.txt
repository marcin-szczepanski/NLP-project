Important Warranty Information Regarding Television Format Viewing
1.	 Functionalities related to Digital TV (DVB) are only available in countries/areas where DVB-T (MPEG2 and MPEG4 AVC) digital terrestrial
signals are broadcasted or where you are able to access to a compatible DVB-C (MPEG2 and MPEG4 AAC) cable-TV service. Please check
with your local dealer the possibility to receive DVB-T or DVB-C signal.
2.	 DVB-T is the DVB European consortium standard for the broadcast transmission of digital terrestrial television and DVB-C is that for the broadcast
transmission of digital TV over cable. However, some differentiated features like EPG (Electric Programme Guide), VOD (Video On Demand) and so
on, are not included in this specification. So, they cannot be workable at this moment.
3.	 Although this TV set meets the latest DVB-T and DVB-C standards, as of [August, 2008], the compatibility with future DVB-T digital terrestrial
and DVB-C digital cable broadcasts cannot be guaranteed.
4.	 Depending on the countries/areas where this TV set is used some cable-TV providers may charge an additional fee for such a service and
you may be required to agree to terms and conditions of their business.
5.	 Some Digital TV functions might be unavailable in some countries or regions and DVB-C might not work correctly with some cable service
providers.
6.	 For more information, please contact your local Samsung customer care centre.

Network Connection
Network Connection - Wireless
You can connect your TV to your LAN through a standard wireless router or modem. To connect wirelessly, you must first
attach a “Samsung Wireless LAN Adapter” (WIS09ABGN, WIS09ABGN2, WIS10ABGN - sold separately) to either the USB 1
(HDD) or USB 2 port on the side of your TV. See the illustration below.

Samsung’s Wireless LAN adapter is sold separately and is offered by select retailers and Ecommerce sites. Samsung’s
Wireless LAN adapter supports the IEEE 802.11a/b/g and n communication protocols. Samsung recommends using IEEE
802.11n. When you play video over a network connection, the video may not be played smoothly.
Most wireless network systems incorporate a security system that requires devices that access the network through an access
point or wireless router (typically a wireless IP Sharer) to transmit an encrypted security code called an access key.
If Pure High-throughput (Greenfield) 802.11n mode is selected and the Encryption type is set to WEP, TKIP or TKIP AES
(WPS2Mixed) for your wireless router, Samsung TVs will not support a connection in compliance with new Wi-Fi certification
specifications.
Network Connection - Wired
There are two main ways to connect your TV to your network using cable, depending on your network setup. They are

Troubleshooting
If the TV seems to have a problem, first try this list of possible problems and solutions. If none of these troubleshooting tips
apply, visit “www.samsung.com”, then click on Support, or call Samsung customer service centre.
Issues

Solutions and Explanations

The TV will not turn on.

•	 Make sure the AC power cord is securely plugged in to the wall outlet and the TV.
•	 Make sure the wall outlet is working.
•	 Try pressing the POWER button on the TV to make sure the problem is not the remote. If
the TV turns on, refer to “Remote control does not work” below.

There is no picture/video.

•	 Check cable connections (remove and reconnect all cables connected to the TV and
external devices).
•	 Set your external device’s (Cable/Set top Box, DVD, Blu-ray etc) video outputs to match
the connections to the TV input. For example, if an external device’s output is HDMI, it
should be connected to an HDMI input on the TV.
•	 Make sure your connected devices are powered on.
•	 Be sure to select the TV’s correct source by pressing the SOURCE button on the remote
control.
•	 Reboot the connected device by reconnecting the device’s power cable.

The remote control does not work.

•	 Replace the remote control batteries with the poles (+/–) in the right direction.
•	 Clean the sensor’s transmission window on the remote.
•	 Try pointing the remote directly at the TV from 5~6 feet away.

The cable/set top box remote control
doesn’t turn the TV on or off, or
adjust the volume.

•	 Program the Cable/Set top box remote control to operate the TV. Refer to the Cable/Set
user manual for the SAMSUNG TV code.

Securing the TV to the Wall
Caution: Pulling, pushing, or climbing onto the TV may cause the TV to fall. In particular, ensure that your
children do not hang over or destabilize the TV; doing so may cause the TV to tip over, resulting in serious
injuries or death. Follow all safety precautions provided on the included Safety Flyer. For added stability, install
the anti-fall device for safety purposes, as follows.
To avoid the TV from falling
1.	 Put the screws into the clamps and firmly fasten them onto the
wall. Confirm that the screws have been firmly installed onto the
wall.

✎✎ You may need additional material such as an anchor
depending on the type of wall.

✎✎ Since the necessary clamps, screws, and string are not
supplied, please purchase these additionally.

2.	 Remove the screws from the centre back of the TV, put the
screws into the clamps, and then fasten the screws onto the TV
again.

✎✎ Screws may not be supplied with the product. In this case,

please purchase the screws of the following specifications.

✎✎ Screw Specifications

3.	 Connect the clamps fixed onto the TV and the clamps fixed onto
the wall with a strong string and then tie the string tightly.

Wall

✎✎ NOTE

xx Install the TV near to the wall so that it does not fall backwards.
xx It is safe to connect the string so that the clamps fixed on the wall are equal to or lower than the clamps fixed on
the TV.

xx Untie the string before moving the TV.
4.	 Verify all connections are properly secured. Periodically check connections for any sign of fatigue for failure. If you have any
doubt about the security of your connections, contact a professional installer.
