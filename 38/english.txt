Installation
Installation Precautions

yy Place the projector in a well-ventilated
environment.
-	 To prevent internal heat build-up,
install the projector in a wellventilated place.
Do not place anything near the
projector as this may block its air
vents. If the air vents are blocked,
the internal temperature will
increase.

-	 Do not place the projector on a
carpet or rug. If the vent is on the
bottom, use the projector on a solid
level surface and ensure the vent is
not blocked.

-	 Be sure to prevent foreign objects
such as paper debris from entering
the projector.

-	 Leave enough distance (30 cm or
more) around the projector.

yy Do not place the projector in a hot
or humid environment.
- Do not place the projector in a hot,
cold, or humid environment.
y
Do
not place the projector in a place
y
where it will easily attract dust.
- This may result in fire.
y
y Never open any cover on the
projector. There is a high risk of
electric shock.
y
y The projector is manufactured using
high-precision technology. You may,
however, see tiny black dots and/
or bright colored dots (red, blue, or
green) that continuously appear on
the projector screen. This is a normal
result of the manufacturing process
and does not indicate a malfunction.
y
y The remote control may not work
in an environment where a lamp
equipped with electronic ballasts or
a three-wavelength fluorescent lamp
is installed. Replace the lamp with an
international standard lamp for the
remote control to work normally.

PREPARATION

Projection Distance per Screen Size

1	 Place the projector on a sturdy, level surface, together with the PC or audio/video
source.

2	 Place the projector an appropriate distance away from the screen. The distance
between the projector and the screen determines the actual size of the image.

3	 Position the projector so that the lens is at a right angle to the screen. If the

projector is not at a right angle, the projected image will look distorted. To correct the
distortion, use the keystone function. (See page 27.)

4	 Connect the power cord of the projector and the connected device to the wall outlet.

3D FUNCTION

3D FUNCTION
3D technology uses different video frames for each eye to add depth to the video.

While Watching 3D
WARNING
yy 	If you view 3D video or images too
closely for a long period of time, your
eyesight may become worse.
yy 	If you watch the projector or game
screen for a long time with 3D glasses
on, you may experience dizziness or
eye fatigue.
yy People with chronic diseases
(epilepsy, cardiovascular disease,
blood pressure-related diseases,
etc.), pregnant women, and people
with serious motion sickness should
avoid watching 3D video.
yy People with stereo blindness, or with
stereopsis problems, should also
avoid watching 3D video content. It
may cause double vision or visual
discomfort.
yy People with strabismus, amblyopia,
or astigmatism may have difficulty
perceiving video depth and may be
fatigued easily due to double vision
or other ailments. It is recommended
to rest more frequently than other
viewers.
yy 	Because 3D can be recognized as
real, some viewers may get surprised
or overexcited.

yy 	Do not watch 3D images near fragile
objects or any objects that can be
knocked over easily.
yy 	Take care not to injure yourself as
you may subconsciously try to move
away from the life-like 3D images.

3D FUNCTION

yy Warning about photosensitivity
seizures
- Some users may experience a
seizure or other abnormal symptoms
when they are exposed to a flashing
light or particular patterns from a
video game. If anyone in your family
has a history of epilepsy or has ever
experienced any kind of seizure,
please consult your doctor before
viewing 3D images.
If you experience one of the following
symptoms while watching a 3D
video, stop watching the 3D video
immediately and take a rest.
- Dizziness, switched eyesight,
twitching of the eye or facial
muscles, involuntary movements,
cramp, loss of consciousness,
confusion, loss of sense of direction,
or nausea. If the symptom does
not disappear, please consult your
doctor.
yy 	You can reduce the risk of
photosensitive seizures by taking the
following preventive measures.
- Take a rest of 5 to 15 mins. for every
1 hour of viewing.
- If vision varies between each eye,
correct the variation before beginning
to watch a 3D video.
- Ensure that the 3D video is directly in
front of you, at eye level.
- You should stop watching if you
experience a headache, fatigue or
dizziness.
- Do not view 3D images for a long
period of time when you are tired or ill.

49

CAUTION
yy Extra special care is required for
children watching a 3D video.

When Watching 3D Video
yy 	Prevent children of 5 years or
younger from watching a 3D video. It
may impair the development of their
eyes.
yy Children 10 years old or younger are
still developing their eyesight and may
have an excessive tendency to touch
or jump at the screen. Adult guidance
and supervision is recommended.
yy Since the distance between the eyes
is narrower for children than in adults,
children tend to notice a greater
difference in the images seen by each
eye. Therefore, even while watching
the same 3D video, children may
have a greater depth perception than
adults.
yy Young people of 19 years old or
younger may respond with sensitivity
to the light stimuli of 3D content.
Excessive viewing when fatigued is
not recommended.
yy Elderly viewers may have a reduced
depth perception than younger
viewers. Avoid watching video nearer
than the recommended distance.
yy 	Watch 3D images within the optimum
viewing angle and distance.
yy 	If you are outside the viewing angle
or distance, you may not be able to
see 3D images. You cannot view 3D
images when you are lying down.

50

3D FUNCTION

yy You may see left and right images
overlapped during projector
initialization after it is powered on. It
may take some time for optimization.
yy It may take some time for the 3D
image to look normal after you turn
your eyes away from the screen and
look back at the 3D image.
yy It may flicker slightly while watching
3D images under a 3 wavelength
lamp fluorescent light (50 Hz to
60 Hz) or near windows. If so, it is
recommended to block the sun light
with a curtain and to dim the lights.
yy The 3D glasses must be DLP-LINK
(DLP Ready) type.
yy You may not be able to watch 3D
properly if there is an obstacle
between the projector and 3D
glasses.
yy Install the 3D projector as far as
possible from other devices.
yy If a future 3D broadcasting format
that is not supported by this projector
becomes the standard, an additional
device such as a set-top box may be
required.

Please check the following when
using 3D glasses.
yy Do not use 3D glasses as ordinary
glasses, sunglasses or protective
goggles.
- If you do so, this may cause injury.
yy Do not store 3D glasses in very hot
or very cold conditions. If you do, this
may cause them to become distorted.
Do not use distorted glasses.
yy Do not drop 3D glasses or allow
them to come into contact with other
objects.
- This may cause product malfunction.
yy The lenses of 3D glasses are easily
scratched. Use a soft clean cloth
when cleaning them.
yy Foreign particles on the cloth may
cause scratches.
yy Do not scratch the surface of the 3D
glasses' lenses with sharp objects
or wipe them with chemicals. If the
lenses get scratched, images may not
look normal when viewing 3D.

3D FUNCTION

51

Requirements for Watching 3D Images
* Optimum viewing angle: Top/Bottom/Left/Right 9°
Recommended viewing distance: 3 m to 5 m
Recommended screen size: 101 cm

* Watching 3D videos should be done in dark room environments only.

	NOTE
yy 	The pairing with the DLP-LINK glasses is affected by the intensity of light reflected
from the screen.
Therefore, the pairing with DLP-LINK glasses may not work properly if the light
reflected from the screen is not bright enough, such as when the surrounding area
is bright, the screen is big, or the maximum energy saving mode is enabled.
yy 	Some menus may not work while playing a 3D video.
yy 	You can only watch a 3D video properly when the 3D video format option has been
selected on the projector.

52

yy 	A laptop equipped with the chipsets above can be used but it may not work properly.

2	 Set the video output to XGA 120 Hz and play a video file using a video player that
supports 3D output.
The following video players support 3D output: Stereoscopic Player, nVidia 3D
Vision, and TriDef 3D.

To Use DLP-LINK (DLP-Ready) Type Glasses

1	 While watching 3D images from the projector, press buttons on the glasses.
2	When you press the button, the glasses flicker to be synchronized with the 3D

images.
(The flickering is a unique operation method of DLP-LINK type glasses. It may be
different depending on the glasses type.)

3	 If the glasses flicker or problems occur while watching 3D, first turn the lights off to
make the room darker. Contact your projector seller for queries about the glasses.
