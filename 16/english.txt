-- This may cause the projector to
fall, causing injury or death.
•	 Do not install the product in a
place with no ventilation (e.g., on
a bookshelf or in a closet) or on a
carpet or cushion.
-- This may result in fire due to the
increase in internal temperature.
•	 Do not place the product close to
sources of steam, oil or oil mist,
such as humidifiers and kitchen
counters.
-- Failure to do so may result in
fire, electric shock, or corrosion.
•	 Do not install the product onto

Installation
Installation Precautions
ENGLISH

•	 Place the projector in a wellventilated environment.
-- To prevent internal overheating,
install the projector in a wellventilated place. Do not place
anything near the projector. That
may block its air vents. If the air
vents are blocked, the internal
temperature of the projector will
increase.

-- Do not place the projector on a
carpet or rug. If the projector's
inlet vent is on the bottom, be
careful not to block the vent and
always use the projector on a
solid, level surface.

-- Be sure to prevent foreign
objects such as paper debris
from entering the projector.

-- Leave an adequate open area
(30 cm or more) around the
projector.

•	 Do not place the projector in a hot,
cool, or humid environment.
•	 Do not place the projector in a place
where it will easily attract dust.
-- This may result in fire.
•	 Never open any cover on the
projector. There is a high risk of
electric shock.
•	 The projector is manufactured using
high-precision technology. You may,
however, see tiny black dots and/
or bright colored dots (red, blue or
green) that continuously appear
on the projector screen. This is a
normal result of the manufacturing
process and does not indicate a
malfunction.
•	 The remote control may not work
in an environment where a lamp
equipped with electronic ballasts
or a three-wavelength fluorescent
lamp is installed. Replace the lamp
with an international standard lamp
for the remote control to work
normally.
•	 To install to the ceiling, attach the
ceiling-type bracket to the projector
with M4 x 8 mm screws.

Projection Distance per Screen Size

1  Place the projector on a sturdy, level surface, together with the PC or audio/
video source.

2  Place the projector an appropriate distance away from the screen. The distance
projector is not at a right angle, the projected image will look distorted. To
correct the distortion, use the Edge Adj function.

4  Connect the power cord of the projector and the connected device to the wall
outlet.
