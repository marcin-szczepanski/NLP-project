Wireless network connection

Another network connection is using the supplied wireless adapter.
This recorder supports an IEEE 802.11n wireless module using supplied wireless LAN adapter, which also supports
the 802.11b/g standards. For the best wireless performance, we recommend the use of a IEEE 802.11n certified Wi-Fi
network (access point or wireless router).
Refer to the setup instructions supplied with your access point or wireless router for detailed connection steps and
network settings.
The following connection example explain how to connect to the internet using an access point or wireless router.

Notes on Network Connection

l	 For

the purpose of better transmission, place the
recorder as close as possible to the access point.

l	 Many

network connection problems during set up can
often be fixed by re-setting the router or modem.
After connecting the recorder to the home network,
quickly power off and/or disconnect the power cable of
the home network router or cable modem. Then power
on and/or connect the power cable again.

l	 In

some instances, placing the access point or wireless
router at least 1.5 ft (0.45m) above the floor may
improve the reception.

l	 Move

closer to the access point if possible or re-orient
the recorder so there is nothing between it and the
access point.

l	 Depending

on the internet service provider (ISP), the
number of devices that can receive internet service
may be limited by the applicable terms of service. For
details, contact your ISP.

l	 The

reception quality over wireless depends on many
factors such as type of the access point, distance
between the recorder and access point, and the location
of the recorder.

About DLNA

The DLNA features allow you to browse and play movies, music and photos stored on DLNA media servers connected
on an identical Local Area Network (LAN) as the recorder.
This recorder allows playing files stored on a computer with Nero MediaHome 4 Essentials and a DLNA-compatible
digital media server (PC and Consumer Electronics).
•	Playing a movie subtitle files are only available on
media server created by supplied Nero MediaHome 4
Essentials software on this recorder’s package.
•	The subtitle file name and movie file name have to be
the same and located at the same folder.
•	If subtitle files have been added after a directory has
been indexed already, the user has to remove and readd the folder to the list of shares.
•	The playback and operating quality of the [DLNA]
function may affected by your home network condition.
•	The files from removable media such as USB drive,
DVD-drive etc. on your media server may not be
shared properly.

The Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) is a crossindustry organization of consumer electronics, computing

features and media server’s ability.
•	If you press INFO while a movie file is selected, the
file information is displayed on the screen. But, the
information may not correct comparing the actual file
