Suggestions on food storage

Storing Food
• Do not store food which goes bad easily at low
temperature, such as banana, and melon.

w Caution

• Allow hot food to cool prior to storing. Placing hot food
in the fridge-freezer could spoil other food, and lead to
higher electric bills.
• When storing the food, use a container with a lid. This
prevents moisture from evaporating, and helps food to
keep its taste and nutrients.
• Do not block air vents with food. Smooth circulation of
cold air keeps fridge-freezer temperature even.
• Do not open the door frequently. Opening the door lets
warm air enter the fridge-freezer, and cause
temperature to rise.
• Never keep too many foods in door rack, as this may
stop the door from fully closing.
• Do not store bottles in the freezer compartment - they
may break when frozen.
• Do not refreeze food that has been thawed. This causes
loss of taste and nutrition.
• Do not store pharmaceutical products, scientific
materials or other temperature sensitive products in the
refrigerator.
Products that require strict temperature controls must
not be stored in the refrigerator.

29

Suggestions on food storage

• If you want to quick freeze new food, you put it middle
drawer of freezer compartment, and then press the
EXPRESS FRZ. button.

Note

If you keep the fridge-freezer in a hot, and humid place,
frequently open its door or put a lot of vegetables in it,
dew may form in it, which has no effect on its
performance.
Remove the dew with dust cloth free from care.

30

Care and Maintenance
