not secured completely into socket, fire ignition may break out.

2

‚Ä¢‚ÄÇ Ensure the power cord does not come into contact with hot objects
such as a heater. This may cause a fire or an electric shock hazard.
‚Ä¢‚ÄÇ Do not place a heavy object, or the product itself, on power cables.
Otherwise, this may result in fire or electric shock.
‚Ä¢‚ÄÇ Bend antenna cable between inside and outside building to
prevent rain from flowing in. This may cause water damaged
inside the Product and could give an electric shock.
‚Ä¢‚ÄÇ When mounting TV onto wall make sure to neatly install and
isolate cabling from rear of TV as to not create possibility of electric
shock /fire hazard.
‚Ä¢‚ÄÇ Do not plug too many electrical devices into a single multiple
electrical outlet. Otherwise, this may result in fire due to overheating.
‚Ä¢‚ÄÇ Do not drop the product or let it fall over when connecting
external devices. Otherwise, this may result in injury or damage
to the product.
‚Ä¢‚ÄÇ Keep the anti-moisture packing material or vinyl packing out
