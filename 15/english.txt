Troubleshooting

Cleaning your TV

Cannot control the TV with the remote control.

ENG
ENGLISH

Clean your TV regularly to keep the best performance and to extend
the product lifespan.
yy Make sure to turn the power off and disconnect the power cord
and all other cables first.
yy When the TV is left unattended and unused for a long time,
disconnect the power cord from the wall outlet to prevent
possible damage from lightning or power surges.

Screen, frame, cabinet and stand
To remove dust or light dirt, wipe the surface with a dry, clean, and
soft cloth.
To remove major dirt, wipe the surface with a soft cloth dampened in
clean water or a diluted mild detergent. Then wipe immediately with
a dry cloth.
yy Avoid touching the screen at all times, as this may result in
damage to the screen.
yy Do not push, rub, or hit the screen surface with your fingernail
or a sharp object, as this may result in scratches and image
distortions.
yy Do not use any chemicals as this may damage the product.
yy Do not spray liquid onto the surface. If water enters the TV, it
may result in fire, electric shock, or malfunction.

Power cord
Remove the accumulated dust or dirt on the power cord regularly.

Preventing “Image burn” or “Burn-in” on
your TV screen
yy If a fixed image displays on the TV screen for a long period
of time, it will be imprinted and become a permanent
disfigurement on the screen. This is “image burn” or “burn-in”
and not covered by the warranty.
yy If the aspect ratio of the TV is set to 4:3 for a long period of
time, image burn may occur on the letterboxed area of the
screen.
yy Avoid displaying a fixed image on the TV screen for a long
period of time (2 or more hours for LCD) to prevent image
burn.

WARNING!

ENGLISH
ENG

Never place a television set in an unstable location. A television set
may fall, causing serious personal injury or death. Many injuries,
particularly to children, can be avoided by taking simple precautions
such as:
yy Using cabinets or stands recommended by the manufacturer
of the television set.
yy Only using furniture that can safely support the television set.
yy Ensuring the television set is not overhanging the edge of the
supporting furniture.
yy Not placing the television set on tall furniture (for example,
cupboards or bookcases) without anchoring both the furniture
and the television set to a suitable support.
yy Not placing the television set on cloth or other materials that
may be located between the television set and supporting
furniture.
yy Educating children about the dangers of climbing on furniture
to reach the television set or its controls.
If your existing television set is being retained and relocated, the same
considerations as above should be applied.
