to fall, causing injury or
death.
•	 Do not install the product in a
place with no ventilation (e.g.,
on a bookshelf or in a closet) or
on a carpet or cushion.
--This may result in fire due
to the increase in internal
temperature.
•	 Do not place the product close
to sources of steam, oil or oil
mist, such as humidifiers and
kitchen counters.
--Failure to do so may result

-- If you do not clean the
projector, dust will accumulate
inside and may create a fire
hazard or malfunction.
•	 When cleaning plastic parts,
such as the projector case,
disconnect the product from the
power first and wipe with a soft
cloth. Do not spray with water
or wipe with a wet cloth. Never
use glass cleaner, automobile
or industrial polish, abrasives
or wax, benzene, alcohol, etc.

PREPARATION

Installation
Installation Precautions
•	 Place the projector in a wellventilated environment.
-- To prevent internal overheating,
install the projector in a wellventilated place.
Do not place anything near
the projector that may block
its air vents. If the air vents
are blocked, the internal
temperature of the projector will
increase.

--Do not place the projector
on a carpet or rug. If the
projector's inlet vent is on
the bottom, be careful not to
block the vent and always
use the projector on a solid,
level surface.

--Be sure to prevent foreign
objects such as paper debris
from entering the projector.

21

--Leave an adequate open
area (30 cm or more) around
the projector.

•	 Do not install the projector in a
hot or humid environment.
--Only install the projector
in a place of moderate
temperature and low
humidity.
•	 Do not install the projector in a
place where it can attract dust.
--There is a risk of fire.
•	 Never open any cover on the
projector. There is a high risk of
electric shock.
•	 This projector is manufactured
using high-precision technology.
You may, however, see tiny
black dots and/or bright colored
dots that continuously appear
on the projector screen.
This is a normal result of the
manufacturing process and
does not indicate a malfunction.
•	 The remote control may not
work in an environment where
a lamp equipped with electronic
ballasts or a three-wavelength
fluorescent lamp is installed.
Replace the lamp with an
international standard lamp
for the remote control to work
normally.

22 PREPARATION

Projection Distance per Screen Size

1  Place the projector on a sturdy, level surface, together with the
computer or audio/video source.

2  Place the projector an appropriate distance away from the screen.

The distance between the projector and the screen determines the
actual size of the image.
3  Position the projector so that the lens is at a right angle to the screen.
If the lens is not perpendicular to the screen, the projected image will
appear distorted. To correct the distortion, use the Keystone function.
(See page 32.)
4  Connect the power cords of the projector and the connected devices to
the wall outlet.

How to Install the Projector On a Tripod
•	 You can install the projector using a camera tripod.
•	 As shown below, you can mount the projector instead of a camera on
the tripod.
•	 When stabilizing the tripod, we recommend using a locking bolt of
standard size 4.5 mm or less. The maximum size allowed for the locking
bolt is 5.5 mm. (If it is longer than the maximum allowed size, it may
damage the projector.)

28 USING THE PROJECTOR
•	 If you do not intend to use the projector for a long time, leave the battery
charged at 40 to 50 %.
•	 The battery is automatically recharged when the projector is connected
to a power supply.
•	 Charge the battery fully when you first use the projector.
•	 The battery standard usage time given in the manual is based on
measurements taken by LG; the actual time may vary depending upon
usage.
•	 Battery usage time may vary depending on broadcast type, operating
temperature, period of use, and user preferences.
•	 As the battery is consumable, its lifetime gradually decreases. When the
battery’s life is reduced by half, replace it with a new battery from an LG
Electronics customer center.
•	 Do not charge the battery using any equipment other than that supplied
with the product. This may damage the battery or cause a fire.
•	 Always use a battery that is approved and certified by LG Electronics,
Inc. Failure to do so may result in an explosion or fire.
•	 If the battery is leaking or giving off an odor, discontinue its use
immediately and contact LG Electronics Customer Support Center.
•	 The battery contains lithium-ion, so please handle with care. Failure to
do so may result in an explosion or fire.
