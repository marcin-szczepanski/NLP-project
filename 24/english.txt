Guidelines for safe and efficient use

Please read these simple guidelines. Not following these guidelines may be dangerous
or illegal. Should a fault occur, a software tool is built into your device that will gather
a fault log. This tool gathers only data specific to the fault, such as signal strength, cell
ID position in sudden call drop and applications loaded. The log is used only to help
determine the cause of the fault. These logs are encrypted and can only be accessed
by an authorised LG Repair centre should you need to return your device for repair.

Exposure to radio frequency energy

Radio wave exposure and Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) information.

This mobile phone model LG-D855 has been designed to comply with applicable safety

requirements for exposure to radio waves. These requirements are based on scientific

guidelines that include safety margins designed to assure the safety of all persons,
regardless of age and health.

- The radio wave exposure guidelines employ a unit of measurement known as the
Specific Absorption Rate (SAR). Tests for SAR are conducted using standardised
methods with the phone transmitting at its highest certified power level in all used
frequency bands.

- While there may be differences between the SAR levels of various LG phone models,
they are all designed to meet the relevant guidelines for exposure to radio waves.

- The SAR limit recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing
Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) is 2 W/kg averaged over 10g of tissue.

- The highest SAR value for this model phone tested for use at the ear is 0.291 W/kg
(10g) and when worn on the body is 0.269 W/Kg (10 g).

m I

- This device meets RF exposure guidelines when used either in the normal use
position against the ear or when positioned at least 1.5 cm away from the body.
When a carry case, belt clip or holder is used for body-worn operation, it should not
contain metal and should position the product at least 1.5 cm away from your body.
In order to transmit data files or messages, this device requires a quality connection
to the network. In some cases, transmission of data files or messages may be
delayed until such a connection is available. Ensure the above separation distance
instructions are followed until the transmission is completed.

Product care and maintenance

A WARNING

Only use batteries, chargers and accessories approved for use with this
particular phone model. The use of any other types may invalidate any
approval or warranty applying to the phone and may be dangerous.

- Do not disassemble this unit. Take it to a qualified service technician when repair

work is required.

- Repairs under warranty, at LG's discretion, may include replacement parts or boards

that are either new or reconditioned, provided that they have functionality equal to
that of the parts being replaced.

- Keep away from electrical appliances such as TVs, radios and personal computers.
- The unit should be kept away from heat sources such as radiators or cookers.
- Do not drop.

- Do not subject this unit to mechanical vibration or shock.

- Switch off the phone in any area where you are required to by special regulations.

a I

For example, do not use your phone in hospitals as it may affect sensitive medical
equipment.

- Do not handle the phone with wet hands while it is being charged. It may cause an
electric shock and can seriously damage your phone.

- Do not charge a handset near flammable material as the handset can become hot
and create a fire hazard.

- Use a dry cloth to clean the exterior of the unit (do not use solvents such as benzene,
thinner or alcohol).

- Do not charge the phone when it is on soft furnishings.

- The phone should be charged in a well ventilated area.

- Do not subject this unit to excessive smoke or dust.

- Do not keep the phone next to credit cards or transport tickets; it can affect the
information on the magnetic strips.

- Do not tap the screen with a sharp object as it may damage the phone.

- Do not expose the phone to liquid or moisture.

- Use accessories like earphones cautiously. Do not touch the antenna unnecessarily.

- Do not use, touch or attempt to remove or fix broken, chipped or cracked glass.
Damage to the glass display due to abuse or misuse is not covered under the
warranty.

- Your phone is an electronic device that generates heat during normal operation.
Extremely prolonged, direct skin contact in the absence of adequate ventilation may
result in discomfort or minor burns. Therefore, use care when handling your phone
during or immediately after operation.

- If your phone gets wet, immediately unplug it to dry off completely. Do not attempt
to accelerate the drying process with an external heating source, such as an oven,
microwave or hair dryer.

- The liquid in your wet phone, changes the color of the product label inside your
phone. Damage to your device as a result of exposure to liquid is not covered under
your warranty.

\I I

Efficient phone operation

Electronics devices

All mobile phones may receive interference, which could affect performance.

- Do not use your mobile phone near medical equipment without requesting
permission. Avoid placing the phone over pacemakers, for example, in your breast
pocket.

- Some hearing aids might be disturbed by mobile phones.

- Minor interference may affect TVs, radios, PCs etc.

- Use your phone in temperatures between 0¬∞C and 40¬∞C, if possible. Exposing your
phone to extremely low or high temperatures may result in damage, malfunction, or
even explosion.

Road safety

Check the laws and regulations on the use of mobile phones in the area when you

drive.

- Do not use a hand-held phone while driving.

- Give full attention to driving.

- Pull off the road and park before making or answering a call if driving conditions so
require.

- RF energy may affect some electronic systems in your vehicle such as car stereos
and safety equipment.

- When your vehicle is equipped with an air bag, do not obstruct with installed or
portable wireless equipment. It can cause the air bag to fail or cause serious injury
due to improper performance.

- If you are listening to music whilst out and about, please ensure that the volume is
at a reasonable level so that you are aware of your surroundings. This is of particular
importance when near roads.

00 I

Avoid damage to your hearing

To prevent possible hearing damage, do not listen at high volume
levels for long periods.

Damage to your hearing can occur if you are exposed to loud sound for long periods of

time. We therefore recommend that you do not turn on or off the handset close to your

ear. We also recommend that music and call volumes are set to a reasonable level.

- When using headphones, turn the volume down if you cannot hear the people
speaking near you, or if the person sitting next to you can hear what you are listening
to.

NOTE: Excessive sound pressure from earphones and headphones can
cause hearing loss

Glass Parts

Some parts of your mobile device are made of glass. This glass could break if your
mobile device is dropped on a hard surface or receives a substantial impact. If the glass
breaks, do not touch or attempt to remove it. Stop using your mobile device until the
glass is replaced by an authorised service provider.

Blasting area

Do not use the phone where blasting is in progress. Observe restrictions and follow any
regulations or rules.

CO I

Potentially explosive atmospheres

- Do not use your phone at a refueling point.

- Do not use near fuel or chemicals.

- Do not transport or store flammable gas, liquid or explosives in the same
compartment of your vehicle as your mobile phone or accessories.

In aircraft

Wireless devices can cause interference in aircraft.
- Turn your mobile phone off before boarding any aircraft.
- Do not use it on the ground without permission from the crew.

Children

Keep the phone in a safe place out of the reach of small children. It includes small parts
which may cause a choking hazard if detached.

Emergency calls

Emergency calls may not be available on all mobile networks. Therefore you should
never depend solely on your phone for emergency calls. Check with your local service
provider.

Battery information and care

- You do not need to completely discharge the battery before recharging. Unlike other
battery systems, there is no memory effect that could compromise the battery's
performance.

- Use only LG batteries and chargers. LG chargers are designed to maximize the
battery life.

- Do not disassemble or short-circuit the battery.

- Keep the metal contacts of the battery clean.

- Replace the battery when it no longer provides acceptable performance. The battery
pack may be recharged hundreds of times before it needs replacing.

- Recharge the battery if it has not been used for a long time to maximize usability.

- Do not expose the battery charger to direct sunlight or use it in high humidity, such as
in the bathroom.

- Do not leave the battery in hot or cold places, as this may deteriorate battery
performance.

- Risk of explosion if battery is replaced by an incorrect type. Dispose of used batteries
according to the instructions.

- If you need to replace the battery, take it to the nearest authorised LG Electronics
service point or dealer for assistance.

- Always unplug the charger from the wall socket after the phone is fully charged to
save unnecessary power consumption of the charger.

- Actual battery life will depend on network configuration, product settings, usage
patterns, battery and environmental conditions.

- Make sure that no sharp-edged items such as animal's teeth or nails, come into
contact with the battery. This could cause a fire.

Anti-Theft Guide

You can set up your device to prevent other people from using it if it‚Äòs been reset to
factory settings without your permission. For example, if your device is lost, stolen, or
wiped, only someone with your Google account or screen lock information can use the
device.

All you need to make sure your device is protected is:

- Set a screen lock: If your device is lost or stolen but you have a screen lock
set, the device can‚Äòt be erased using the Settings menu unless your screen is
unlocked.

- Add your Google account on your device: If your device is wiped but you have
your Google account on it, the device can‚Äòt finish the setup process until your
Google account information is entered again.

After your device is protected, you‚Äòll need to either unlock your screen or enter your
Google account password if you need to do a factory reset. This ensures that you or
someone you trust is doing the reset.

NOTE:

- Do not forget your Google account and password you had added to your
device prior to performing a factory reset. If you can't provide the account
information during the setup process, you won't be able to use the device
at all after performing the factory reset.

Question

How do I create the
Unlock Pattern?

Answer

. From the Home screen, tap and
hold the Recent Key El.

. Tap System settings > Display tab

> Lock screen.

Tap Select screen lock > Pattern.

The first time you do this, a short

tutorial about creating an Unlock

Pattern will appear.

. Set up by drawing your pattern
once, and once again for
confirmation.

Precautions to take when using the

pattern look.

It is very important to remember the

unlock pattern you set. You will not

be able to access your phone if you
use an incorrect pattern five times.

You have five chances to enter your

unlock pattern, PIN or password. If you

have used all 5 opportunities, you can
try again after 30 seconds. (Or, if you
preset the backup PIN, you can use
the backup PIN code to unlock the
pattern.)
