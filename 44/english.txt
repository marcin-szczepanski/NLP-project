

Because AACS (Advanced Access Content
System) is approved as content protection system for BD format, similar to use of CSS (Content
Scramble System) for DVD format, certain restrictions are imposed on playback, analogue signal
output, etc., of AACS protected contents. The
operation of this product and restrictions on this
product may vary depending on your time of purchase as those restrictions may be adopted
and/or changed by AACS after the production of
this product.
Furthermore, BD-ROM Mark and BD+ are additionally used as content protection systems for
BD format, which imposes certain restrictions
including playback restrictions for BD-ROM Mark
and/or BD+ protected contents. To obtain additional information on AACS, BD-ROM Mark, BD+,
or this product, please contact an authorized
Customer Service Centre.
Many BD-ROM/DVD discs are encoded with copy
protection. Because of this, you should only connect your player directly to your TV, not to a VCR.
Connecting to a VCR results in a distorted picture
from copy-protected discs.

PCM 7.1ch *4

Notes:
*1 The secondary and interactive audio may not be included in the output bitstream if [SPDIF] or [HDMI]
option is set to [Primary Pass-Thru]. (Except LPCM Codec : the output always include interactive and
secondary audio.)

*3 The [PCM Multi-CH]/[Primary Pass-Thru] setting of the [HDMI] option and [DTS re-encode] setting of the
[SPDIF] option cannot be set together. If you set the [HDMI] option to [PCM Multi-CH] or
[Primary Pass-Thru], the [SPDIF] option is set to [PCM Stereo] automatically. Also, if you set the [SPDIF]
option to [DTS Re-encode] and the [HDMI] option is set to [PCM Stereo] automatically.
*4 The LPCM audio recorded at 192kHz sampling frequency will be outputted as stereo sound.
*5 On the PCM audio output, the sampling frequency of HDMI/SPDIF (DIGITAL AUDIO OUT) is limited to
96 kHz.
*6 If the [HDMI] or [SPDIF] option is set to [DTS re-encode], the audio output is limited to 48 kHz and
5.1 ch. If the [HDMI] or [SPDIF] option is set to [DTS re-encode], the DTS Re-encode audio is outputted
for BD-ROM discs, and the original audio is outputted for the other discs (like [Primary Pass-Thru]).

Reference

*2 This player automatically selects the HDMI audio according to the decoding capability of the connected
HDMI device even though [HDMI] option is set to [Primary Pass-Thru].

• If [HDMI] option is set to [PCM Multi-CH] and [SPDIF] option is set to [Primary Pass-Thru] when the unit
plays back Dolby Digital Plus audio, SPDIF (DIGITAL AUDIO OUT) jack is limited to “PCM 2ch”.
• If the HDMI connection is version 1.3 and Dolby Digital Plus/Dolby TrueHD/DTS-HD is outputted from
HDMI OUT jack, SPDIF (DIGITAL AUDIO OUT) jack is limited to “PCM 2ch” (When the HDMI and SPDIF
are connected simultaneously).
• The audio is always output as PCM 48kHz/16 bit during Audio CD or MP3/WMA file is playing back.
• The Dolby TrueHD audio recorded on the BD disc is consist of Dolby Digital and TrueHD audio.
The Dolby Digital audio is outputted through DIGITAL AUDIO OUT jacks and DD displays on the screen if
the player does not use Lossless audio. (for example, when [HDMI] is set to [PCM Stereo] or
[DTS Re-encode] and [SPDIF] is set to [Primary Pass-Thru])
