Installation Instructions
The following instructions will guide you through the initial steps of setting up your dryer.
Please note that every section of this manual provides important information regarding the
preparation and use of your dryer, and it is important that you review this entire manual
before proceeding with any installation or use. Be sure to observe all listed warnings and
cautions. These installation instructions are intended for use by qualified installers. Read
these installation instructions completely and carefully.

Safety Information
Risk of Injury
The dryer is very heavy so you shouldn’t
try to lift it alone.
Do not lift the dryer by grasping any of the
protruding parts, e.g. the jog dial or the
door, they may break off.

Risk of Falling or Tripping Up
Ensure there are no loose hoses or
cables.

Check the dryer for damage occurred
during transportation.
Do not connect the dryer if it has visible
signs of damage.
If you are not confident, contact your local
LG agent. Always empty the dryer
completely before transporting it.

Your dryer should not be located near to a
gas hob, cooker, heater or grill, as flames
from the burners could damage your dryer.
When the dryer is fitted beneath a work
surface, allow 30cm~50cm space at either
side of the dryer and at the back of the dryer
to allow air to exit the rear grille. This air
flow is critical for condensation of water
during the drying process.
If you use this dryer near or stacked on top
of your washing machine, separate main
plugs and sockets must be used for each
appliance. Do not use 2-way adaptor or
extension lead.
You can stack the dryer on top your
washing machine to save space. A stacking
kit is available from your local appliance
specialist.

■ Stacking Installation Instructions
Your LG dryer can be placed on top of a front loading washing machine and securely fixed
with a stacking kit (see following page for instructions). This installation must be conducted
by an experienced installer to ensure it has been installed correctly.
An installer will ensure you have the correct stacking kit for your model of washing
machine and will ensure it is firmly fixed. For these reasons, expert fitting is essential.

CAUTION
CAUTION Concerning the power cord
Most appliances recommend they be placed upon a dedicated circuit; that is, a single
outlet circuit which powers only that appliance and has no additional outlets or branch
circuits. Check the specification page of this owner's manual to be certain.
Do not overload wall outlets. Overloaded wall outlets, loose or damaged wall outlets,
extension cords, frayed power cords, or damaged or cracked wire insulations are
dangerous. Any of these could result in and electric shock or fire. Periodically examine
the cord of your appliance, and if its appearance indicates damage or deterioration,
unplug it, discontinue use of the appliance, and have the cord replaced with an exact
replacement part by an authorized servicer.
Protect the power cord from physical or mechanical abuse, such as being twisted,
kinked, trapped in a door, or walked upon. Pay particular attention to plugs, wall outlets,
and the point where the cord exits the appliance.

4. Press the
Start/Pause
button.

NOTE
A high atmospheric temperature and
a small room may both increase
drying time as well as energy
consumption.

WARNING
Do not drink the condensed water.

CAUTION
If the laundry is not spun at a high speed
during washing, energy consumption
and drying time will increase.
In some instances, LED window may
display “
” (Empty water symbol) and
the dryer may stop because the water

Caring for Your Dryer
■ Ventilation Grill and Cool Air

Inlet Grill

3. Connect
drain hose
to the kit.

Vacuum the front ventilation grill 3-4 times a
year to make sure there is no build up of lint
or dirt that may cause improper air flow.

■ Moisture Sensor?

NOTE
- Warm air is exhausted through the
ventilation grill.
- Adequate ventilation should be
provided to avoid the back flow of
gases into the room from units
burning other fuels, such as open
fires.

■ Condensed Water Drain-out
Normally, condensed water is pumped up to
the water container where water is collected
until manually emptied. Water can also be
drained out directly to a mains drain,
especially when the dryer is stacked on top
of a washing machine.
With a connecting kit for the mains drain
hose, simply change the water path and reroute to the drainage facility as below:
1. Take
connecting
kit out.

2. Separate
water
container
hose from
the kit.

The device senses the moisture level of the
laundry during operation, which means it
must be cleaned regularly to remove any
build up of lime scale on the surface of the
sensor.
Wipe the sensors inside drum.

Questions

What to do

Dryer won’t run

1. Check dryer is plugged in.
2. Check "Start/Pause" button is pressed.
3. Check door is properly closed.
4. Check room temperature is below 5°C.
5. Check a fuse is blown or the circuit breaker is tripped
and replace them.
(Caution : electric dryers generally use two fuses or
breakers) After emptying the water container and
cleaning filter during operation, you must press
Start/Pause button, then the dryer will operate again.

It takes a long time to dry

1. Filter should be cleaned after each load.
2. Check water container is emptied.
3. Select correct cycle setting for fabric type.
4. Check air ventilation grille or rear vents of dryer are
not obstructed.
5. Check clothes are not excessively wet.
6. Check the dryer is overloaded.

Dryer is operating but
“Time Left” in the display
doesn’t change.

This is not a malfunction.
Drying time is estimated and will recalculate throughout
the cycle as it senses the dryness of the load.
Check filter is clean.

2. Check all the items in the dryer are clean.
3. Check all the laundry has been correctly sorted by
fabric type.

wetness of the clothes and the condition of the filter.

Water is leaking

Check the water hose or drain hose is properly
connected.

The clothes are creased

Check the dryer is not overloaded. Try a shorter drying
time and remove items whilst they still retain a slight
amount of moisture. Use the anti-crease option.

To avoid shrinkage, please follow the care and use
instructions for your garment, as some fabrics shrink
naturally when washed and should not be placed in a dryer.

Troubleshooting Guide
NOTE
Smart Diagnosis™ function is
available only for the products with a
Smart Diagnosis™ mark. Should you
have an analog phone, the Smart
Diagnosis™ function may not
operate.

■ Using Smart Diagnosis™
• Only use this feature when instructed to do
so by the call center. The transmission
sounds similar to a fax machine, and so
has no meaning except to the call center.
• Smart Diagnosis™ cannot be activated if
the dryer does not power up. If this
happens, then troubleshooting must be
done without Smart Diagnosis™.
If you experience problems with your dryer,
call the customer information center. Follow
the call center agent's instructions, and do
the following steps when requested:
1. Press the Power button to turn on the
dryer. Do not press any other buttons or
turn the cycle selector knob.

Max. 10 mm

3. Press and hold the “ (More)” button for
three seconds, while holding the
mouthpiece of your phone close to the
"Smart Diagnosis™" icon and Power
button.
4. Keep the phone in place until the tone
transmission has finished.
This takes about 6 seconds, and the
display will count down the time.
• For best results, do not move the phone
while the tones are being transmitted.
• If the call center agent is not able to get
an accurate recording of the data, you
may be asked to try again.
• Pressing the Power button during the
transmission will shut off the Smart
Diagnosis™.
5. Once the countdown is over and the
tones have stopped, resume your
conversation with the call center agent,
who will then be able to assist you using
the information transmitted for analysis at
the call to customer information center.

NOTE
2. When instructed to do so by the call
center, place the mouthpiece of your
phone close to the "Smart Diagnosis™"
icon and Power
button.

“Smart Diagnosis is a troubleshooting
feature designed to assist, not replace,
the traditional method of troubleshooting
through service calls. The effectiveness
of this feature depends upon various
factors, including, but not limited to, the
reception of the phone being used for
transmission, any external noise that
may be present during the transmission,
and the acoustics of the room where the
machine is located. LG does not
guarantee that Smart Diagnosis would
accurately troubleshoot any given
issue.”
