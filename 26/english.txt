It may cause mechanical failure or could give an electric shock.
Please follow the installation instructions below to prevent the product from
yy
overheating.
--The distance between the product and the wall should be more than 10 cm.
--Do not install the product in a place with no ventilation (e.g., on a bookshelf or in
a cupboard).
--Do not install the product on a carpet or cushion.
--Make sure the air vent is not blocked by a tablecloth or curtain.
Otherwise, this may result in fire.
Take care not to touch the ventilation openings when watching the TV for long
yy
periods as the ventilation openings may become hot. This does not affect the
operation or performance of the product.
Periodically examine the cord of your appliance, and if its appearance indicates damage or
yy
deterioration, unplug it, discontinue use of the appliance, and have the cord replaced with an exact
replacement part by an authorized servicer.
Prevent dust collecting on the power plug pins or outlet. y
yy
This may cause a fire hazard.
Protect the power cord from physical or mechanical abuse, such as being twisted,
yy
kinked, pinched, closed in a door, or walked upon. Pay particular attention to plugs,
wall outlets, and the point where the cord exits the appliance.
Do not press strongly upon the panel with a hand or sharp object such as nail,
yy
pencil or pen, or make a scratch on it.
Avoid touching the screen or holding your finger(s) against it for long periods of
yy
time. Doing so may produce some temporary distortion effects on the screen.
When cleaning the product and its components, unplug the power first and wipe it
yy
with a soft cloth. Applying excessive force may cause scratches or discolouration.
Do not spray with water or wipe with a wet cloth. Never use glass cleaner, car or
industrial shiner, abrasives or wax, benzene, alcohol etc., which can damage the

SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS

Contact the service center once a year to clean the internal parts of the product. y
yy
Accumulated dust can cause mechanical failure.
Refer all servicing to qualified service personnel. Servicing is required when the
yy
apparatus has been damaged in any way, such as power supply cord or plug is
damaged, liquid has been spilled or objects have fallen into the apparatus, the
apparatus has been exposed to rain or moisture, does not operate normally, or has
been dropped.
If the product feels cold to the touch, there may be a small “flicker” when it is turned
yy
on. This is normal, there is nothing wrong with product.
The panel is a high technology TFT product with resolution of two million to six
yy
million pixels. You may see tiny black dots and/or brightly coloured dots (red, blue
or green) at a size of 1 ppm on the panel. This does not indicate a malfunction and
does not affect the performance and reliability of the product.  y
This phenomenon also occurs in third-party products and is not subject to
exchange or refund.
You may find different brightness and colour of the panel depending on your
yy
viewing position(left/right/top/down). y
This phenomenon occurs due to the characteristic of the panel. It is not related with
the product performance, and it is not malfunction.

Displaying a still image (e.g., broadcasting channel logo, on-screen menu, scene from a video
yy
game) for a prolonged time may cause damage to the screen, resulting in retention of the image,
which is known as image sticking. The warranty does not cover the product for image sticking. y
Avoid displaying a fixed image on your television’s screen for a prolonged period (2 or more hours
for LCD, 1 or more hours for Plasma). y
Also, if you watch the TV at a ratio of 4:3 for a long time, image sticking may occur on the borders of
the panel. y
This phenomenon also occurs in third-party products and is not subject to exchange or refund.
yyGenerated Sound
“Cracking” noise: A cracking noise that occurs when watching or turning off the TV is generated by
plastic thermal contraction due to tempera-ture and humidity. This noise is common for products
where thermal deformation is required. Electrical circuit humming/panel buzzing: A low level noise is
generated from a high-speed switching circuit, which supplies a large amount of current to operate a
product. It varies depend-ing on the product. y
This generated sound does not affect the performance and reliability of the product.

ENGLISH

-- When watching 3D contents, take 5 - 15 minute breaks every hour. Viewing 3D contents for a long
period of time may cause headache, dizziness, fatigue or eye strain.
Those that have a photosensitive seizure or chronic illness
yy Some users may experience a seizure or other abnormal symptoms when they are exposed to a
flashing light or particular pattern from 3D contents.
yy Do not watch 3D videos if you feel nausea, are pregnant and/ or have a chronic illness such as epilepsy,
cardiac disorder, or blood pressure disease, etc.
yy 3D Contents are not recommended to those who suffer from stereo blindness or stereo anomaly. Double
images or discomfort in viewing may be experienced.
yy If you have strabismus (cross-eyed), amblyopia (weak eyesight) or astigmatism, you may have trouble
sensing depth and easily feel fatigue due to double images. It is advised to take frequent breaks than
the average adult.
yy If your eyesight varies between your right and left eye, revise your eyesight prior to watching 3D
contents.
Symptoms which require discontinuation or refraining from watching 3D contents
yy Do not watch 3D contents when you feel fatigue from lack of sleep, overwork or drinking.
yy When these symptoms are experienced, stop using/watching 3D contents and get enough rest until the

SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS

11

Viewing Environment
�	 Viewing Distance
-	 Maintain a distance of at least twice the screen diagonal length when watching 3D contents. If you
feel discomfort in viewing 3D contents, move further away from the TV.
Viewing Age
yy Infants/Children
-- Usage/ Viewing 3D contents for children under the age of 5 are prohibited.
-- Children under the age of 10 may overreact and become overly excited because their vision is in
development (for example: trying to touch the screen or trying to jump into it. Special monitoring
and extra attention is required for children watching 3D contents.
-- Children have greater binocular disparity of 3D presentations than adults because the distance
between the eyes is shorter than one of adults. Therefore they will perceive more stereoscopic
depth compared to adults for the same 3D image.
yy Teenagers
-- Teenagers under the age of 19 may react with sensitivity due to stimulation from light in 3D
contents. Advise them to refrain from watching 3D contens for a long time when they are tired.
yy Elderly
-- The elderly may perceive less 3D effect compared to the youth. Do not sit closer to the TV than the
recommended distance.
Cautions when using the 3D glasses
�	 Make sure to use LG 3D glasses. Otherwise, you may not be able to view 3D videos properly.
�	 Do not use 3D glasses instead of your normal glasses, sunglasses or protective goggles.
�	 Using modified 3D glasses may cause eye strain or image distortion.
�	 Do not keep your 3D glasses in extremely high or low temperatures. It will cause deformation.
�	 The 3D glasses are fragile and are easy to be scratched. Always use a soft, clean piece of cloth when
wiping the lenses. Do not scratch the lenses of the 3D glasses with sharp objects or clean/wipe them
with chemicals.
