PREPARATION

■

TV can be placed in standby mode in order to reduce the power consumption. And TV should be
switched off using the power switch on the TV if it will not be watched for some time, as this will
reduce energy consumption.
The energy consumed during use can be significantly reduced if the level of brightness of the picture is
reduced, and this will reduce the overall running cost.

Image shown may differ from your TV.

The purpose of deactivation is to allow deactivation of devices for users who have activated all the available
devices through the web_server and are blocked from activating more devices. DivX VOD allowed the consumer to
activate up to 6 devices under one account, but to replace or deactivate any of those devices, the consumer had
to contact DivX Support and request deletion. Now with this added feature, consumers will be able to deactivate
the device themselves and hence better manage their DivX VOD devices.

IMAGE STICKING MINIMIZATION (ISM) METHOD (PLASMA TV ONLY)
A frozen or still picture displayed on the screen for prolonged periods will result in a ghost image remaining
even when you change the image. Avoid allowing a fixed image to remain on the screen for prolonged periods.
White Wash
White wash removes permanent images from the screen.
Note: An excessive permanent image may be impossible to clear entirely with White Wash.
Orbiter
Orbiter may help prevent ghost images. However, it is best not to allow any fixed image to remain on the
screen. To avoid a permanent image on the screen, the screen will move every 2 minutes.
Colour Wash
The colour block with the screen moved a little and the white pattern are alternately displayed. It is difficult to
sense the afterimage occurred while the temporary afterimage is removed and the colour pattern is operating.

AVL automatically remains on the same level of volume if you change programmes.
Because each broadcasting station has its own signal conditions, volume adjustment may be needed every time
the channel is changed. This feature allows users to enjoy stable volume levels by making automatic adjustments
for each program.
If sound quality or volume is not at the level you want, it is recommended to use a separate home theater system
or amp to cope with different user environments.

OPEN SOURCE LICENSE
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU
General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free
Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License
instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to
make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software,
or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all
the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show
them these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not
reflect on the original authors' reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors
of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we
have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

APPENDIX

178

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that
is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into
another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is
addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running
the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of
any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the
Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any
change.
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
License.
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running
for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception:
if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
Program is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its
terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on
the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than
your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange; or,
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

APPENDIX

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable
work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,
unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

179

APPENDIX
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not ccept
this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate
your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
Program or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You
may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it
and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide
range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the
author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical
distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to
time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of
any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

APPENDIX

180

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to
the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
generally.

NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING
THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to
achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to
where the full notice is found.
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
version.
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the
implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General
Public License for more details.
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the
Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
type `show c' for details.
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer"
for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a
subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is
what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2.1, February 1999
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301
USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
allowed.
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public
License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU
General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically
libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest
you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in
any particular case, based on the explanations below.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to
surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
library or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the
rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code
with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library
after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which
gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the
library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original
version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a
company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.
Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom
of use specified in this license.
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license,
the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary
General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free
programs.
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits
such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more
lax criteria for linking other code with the library.

APPENDIX

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the
ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library,
so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more
frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to
gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use
a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

182

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a
program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from
the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the
copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public
License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A
"work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into
another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus
the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether
that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection
in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library,
and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all
of these conditions:
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
any change.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
License.
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program
that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good
faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,
and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its
terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

APPENDIX

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of
the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function
must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

183

APPENDIX
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the
Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy
of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU
General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU
General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other
change in these notices.
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License
applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being
compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of
the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library
(because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the
work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.
The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and
small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it
is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under
Section 6.)
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of
Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with
the Library itself.
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that
the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its
use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the
user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:

APPENDIX

184

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including
whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work
is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object
code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable
containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at
run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions
into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as
long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to
copy the above specified materials from the same place.
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs
needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need
not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in
an executable that you distribute.
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with
other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate
distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that
you do these two things:
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other
library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and
explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this
License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept
this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your
acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or
works based on it.
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and
this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

APPENDIX

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide
range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the
author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

185

APPENDIX
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License
from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of
any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY,
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it
free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms
(or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source
file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
pointer to where the full notice is found.
<one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option)
any later version.
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General
Public License for more details.
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to
the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

APPENDIX

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer"
for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
3. Distribution Obligations.
3.1. Application of License.
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including
without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of
this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source
Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.
However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.
3.2. Availability of Source Code.
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under
the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via
Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially
became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available
even if the
Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
3.3. Description of Modifications.
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to
create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification
is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in
which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

APPENDIX

188

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
(a) Third Party Claims.
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise
the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the
Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient
detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is
made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has
been obtained.

(b) Contributor APIs.
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of
patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.
(c) Representations.
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant
the rights conveyed by this License.
3.5. Required Notices.
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)
You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License
in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to
Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations
to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for
that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of
Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license
for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from
the rights set forth in this
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any
terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
3.7. Larger Works.
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this
License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered
Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in
the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to
the
extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
skill to be able to understand it.
5. Application of this License.
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related
Covered Code.
6. Versions of the License.

6.2. Effect of New Versions.
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use
it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms
applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

APPENDIX

6.1. New Versions.
Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from
time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

189

APPENDIX
6.3. Derivative Works.
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is
not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases
"Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in
your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling
in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of
themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
8. TERMINATION.
8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered
Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature,
must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against
Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred
to as "Participant") alleging that:
(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted
by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay
Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If
within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by
the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.
(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are
revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
Participant.
8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.
8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall
survive termination.
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

APPENDIX

190

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR
ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY
PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
