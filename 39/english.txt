3D FUNCTION

3D FUNCTION
3D technology uses different video frames for each eye to add depth to the
video.

While Watching 3D
WARNING
•	 If you view 3D video or images too closely for a long period of time, you
may experience eyestrain.
•	 If you watch the projector or game screen for a long time with 3D
glasses on, you may experience dizziness or eye fatigue.
•	 People with chronic diseases (epilepsy, cardiovascular disease, blood
pressure-related diseases, etc.), pregnant women, and people with
serious motion sickness should avoid watching 3D video.
•	 People with stereo blindness, or with stereopsis problems, should also
avoid watching 3D video content. It may cause double vision or visual
discomfort.
•	 People with strabismus, amblyopia, or astigmatism may have difficulty
perceiving video depth and may be fatigued easily due to double vision
or other ailments. It is recommended to rest more frequently than other
viewers.
•	 Because 3D can be perceived as real, some viewers may be surprised
or overexcited.
•	 Do not watch 3D images near fragile objects or any objects that can be
knocked over easily.
•	 Take care not to injure yourself as you may subconsciously try to move
away from the life-like 3D images.

3D FUNCTION

69

•	 Warning about photosensitivity seizures
--Some users may experience a seizure or other abnormal symptoms
when they are exposed to a flashing light or particular patterns from
a video game. If anyone in your family has a history of epilepsy or
has ever experienced any kind of seizure, please consult your doctor
before viewing 3D images.
If you experience one of the following symptoms while watching a 3D
video, stop watching the 3D video immediately and take a rest.
--Dizziness, switched eyesight, twitching of the eye or facial muscles,
involuntary movements, cramp, loss of consciousness, confusion,
loss of sense of direction, or nausea. If the symptom does not
disappear, please consult your doctor.
•	 You can reduce the risk of photosensitive seizures by taking the
following preventive measures.
--Take a rest of 5 to 15 mins. for every 1 hour of viewing.
--If vision varies between each eye, correct the variation before
beginning to watch a 3D video.
--Ensure that the 3D video is directly in front of you, at eye level.
--You should stop watching if you experience a headache, fatigue, or
dizziness.
--Do not view 3D images for a long period of time when you are tired
or ill.
CAUTION
•	 Extra special care is required for children watching a 3D video.

70

3D FUNCTION

When Watching 3D Video
•	 Prevent children of 5 years or younger from watching a 3D video. It may
impair the development of their eyes.
•	 Children 10 years old or younger are still developing their eyesight and
may have an excessive tendency to touch or jump at the screen. Adult
guidance and supervision is recommended.
•	 Since the distance between the eyes is narrower for children than in
adults, children tend to notice a greater difference in the images seen by
each eye. Therefore, even while watching the same 3D video, children
may have a greater depth perception than adults.
•	 Children under 19 years old or younger may respond with sensitivity to
the light stimuli of 3D content. Excessive viewing when fatigued is not
recommended.
•	 Elderly viewers may have a reduced depth perception than younger
viewers. Avoid watching video nearer than the recommended distance.
•	 Watch 3D images within the optimum viewing angle and distance.
•	 If you are outside the viewing angle or distance, you may not be able to
see 3D images. You cannot view 3D images when you are lying down.
•	 You may see left and right images overlapped during projector
initialization after it is powered on. It may take some time for
optimization.
•	 It may take some time for the 3D image to look normal after you turn
your eyes away from the screen and look back at the 3D image.
•	 It may flicker slightly while watching 3D images under a 3 wavelength
lamp fluorescent light (50 Hz to 60 Hz) or near windows. If so, it is
recommended to block the sun light with a curtain and to dim the lights.
•	 The 3D glasses must be DLP-LINK (DLP Ready) type.
•	 You may not be able to watch 3D properly if there is an obstacle
between the projector and 3D glasses.
•	 Install the 3D projector as far as possible from other devices.
•	 If a future 3D broadcasting format that is not supported by this projector
becomes the standard, an additional device such as a set-top box may
be required.

3D FUNCTION

71

Please check the following when using 3D glasses.
•	 Do not use 3D glasses as ordinary glasses, sunglasses, or protective
goggles.
--If you do so, this may cause injury.
•	 Do not store 3D glasses in very hot or very cold conditions. If you do,
this may cause them to become distorted. Do not use distorted glasses.
•	 Do not drop 3D glasses or allow them to come into contact with other
objects.
--This may cause product malfunction.
•	 The lenses of 3D glasses are easily scratched. Use a soft clean cloth
when cleaning them.
•	 Foreign particles on the cloth may cause scratches.
•	 Do not scratch the surface of the 3D glasses' lenses with sharp objects
or wipe them with chemicals. If the lenses get scratched, images may
not look normal when viewing 3D.

72

3D FUNCTION

Requirements for Watching 3D Images
* Optimum viewing angle: Top/Bottom/Left/Right 9°
Recommended viewing distance: 3 m
Recommended screen size: 101 cm

￼
* Watching 3D videos should be done in dark room environments only.

NOTE
•	 The pairing with the DLP-LINK glasses is affected by the intensity of
light reflected from the screen. Therefore, the pairing with DLP-LINK
glasses may not work properly if the light reflected from the screen is
not bright enough, such as when the surrounding area is bright, the
screen is big, or the maximum energy saving mode is enabled.
•	 Some menus may not work while playing a 3D video.
•	 You can only watch a 3D video properly when the 3D video format
option has been selected on the projector.

3D FUNCTION

73

Using the DLP-LINK (DLP-Ready) Type Glasses

1  While watching 3D images from the projector, press buttons on the
glasses.

2  When you press the button, the glasses flicker while synchronizing with
the 3D images. (The flickering is a unique operation method of DLPLINK type glasses. It may be different depending on the glasses type.)

3  If the glasses flicker or problems occur while watching 3D, first turn

the lights off to make the room darker. Contact your projector seller for
queries about the glasses.

To view 3D images
3D imaging is a technology that utilizes the slight difference in left/
right eyes to make the images on the projector appear just like real-life
3-dimensional space.

1  Play supported 3D video titles.
2  Press the 3D button to activate 3D.
3  Turn on the 3D glasses and put them on.
4  While viewing 3D images, press the 3D button on the remote control to
end 3D image viewing.

5  Press the L/R button to switch the playing direction of an image. Select
a screen with better 3D display quality.
--If you press the 3D button during viewing, it returns to 2D.

* Depending on the input signal, the available 3D type may differ.
